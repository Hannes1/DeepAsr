../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6367/74004/6367-74004-0013.flac,BUT WHEN I SAW MICKY SCOWLING AT THE CORNER I KNEW SHE WAS DOING IT TO MAKE HIM JEALOUS GIRLS WON'T STICK AT ANYTHING WHEN THEY WANT TO PROVOKE A CHAP I KNOW IT TO MY COST FOR JENNIE PRICE

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6367/74004/6367-74004-0022.flac,AND HE WOUND UP BY IMPLORING HER TO TELL HIM IF SHE COULD POSSIBLY LOVE HIM A LITTLE BIT AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING I COPIED THE LETTER OUT ON HELIOTROPE PAPER IN MY BEST IMITATION OF THE OLD FELLOW'S HANDWRITING AND SIGNED IT YOURS DEVOTEDLY AND IMPLORINGLY

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6367/74004/6367-74004-0035.flac,HE ASSERTS THAT SYLVIA TURNED SQUARE AROUND AND KISSED THE OLD FELLOW BUT I'M SURE SHE JUST TURNED HER FACE AND GAVE HIM A LOOK AND THEN HE KISSED HER ANYHOW
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6367/74004/6367-74004-0036.flac,THERE THEY BOTH WERE GOING ON AT THE SILLIEST RATE ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY LOVED EACH OTHER AND HOW THE OLD FELLOW THOUGHT SHE LOVED MICKY AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING IT WAS AWFUL I NEVER THOUGHT THE OLD FELLOW OR SYLVIA EITHER COULD BE SO SPOONEY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6367/74004/6367-74004-0037.flac,RUGGLES AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ANYTHING ON EARTH TO BE OUT OF THAT WE KNEW WE'D NO BUSINESS TO BE THERE AND WE FELT AS FOOLISH AS FLATFISH IT WAS A TREMENDOUS RELIEF WHEN THE OLD FELLOW AND SYLVIA GOT UP AT LAST AND TRAILED AWAY BOTH OF THEM LOOKING IDIOTICALLY HAPPY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0000.flac,PART TWO SOME CHRISTIAN SUBJECTS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0001.flac,OUTWARD FORMS AND SYMBOLS MUST BE USED TO CONVEY INTELLECTUAL CONCEPTIONS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0002.flac,AND OF OTHERS OF WHICH WE ARE ABOUT TO SPEAK SO THAT THE ESSENCE OF THE PROBLEMS MAY BE UNDERSTOOD IS THIS THAT HUMAN KNOWLEDGE IS OF TWO KINDS ONE IS THE KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS PERCEPTIBLE TO THE SENSES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0003.flac,THAT IS TO SAY THINGS WHICH THE EYE OR EAR OR SMELL OR TASTE OR TOUCH CAN PERCEIVE WHICH ARE CALLED OBJECTIVE OR SENSIBLE SO THE SUN BECAUSE IT CAN BE SEEN IS SAID TO BE OBJECTIVE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0004.flac,IT IS A REALITY OF THE INTELLECT IT HAS NO OUTWARD FORM AND NO PLACE AND IS NOT PERCEPTIBLE TO THE SENSES FOR EXAMPLE THE POWER OF INTELLECT IS NOT SENSIBLE NONE OF THE INNER QUALITIES OF MAN IS A SENSIBLE THING
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0005.flac,ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE INTELLECTUAL REALITIES SO LOVE IS A MENTAL REALITY AND NOT SENSIBLE FOR THIS REALITY THE EAR DOES NOT HEAR THE EYE DOES NOT SEE THE SMELL DOES NOT PERCEIVE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0006.flac,THE TASTE DOES NOT DISCERN THE TOUCH DOES NOT FEEL EVEN ETHEREAL MATTER THE FORCES OF WHICH ARE SAID IN PHYSICS TO BE HEAT LIGHT ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0007.flac,IS AN INTELLECTUAL REALITY AND IS NOT SENSIBLE IN THE SAME WAY NATURE ALSO IN ITS ESSENCE IS AN INTELLECTUAL REALITY AND IS NOT SENSIBLE THE HUMAN SPIRIT IS AN INTELLECTUAL NOT SENSIBLE REALITY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0008.flac,IN EXPLAINING THESE INTELLECTUAL REALITIES ONE IS OBLIGED TO EXPRESS THEM BY SENSIBLE FIGURES BECAUSE IN EXTERIOR EXISTENCE THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS NOT MATERIAL THEREFORE TO EXPLAIN THE REALITY OF THE SPIRIT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0009.flac,ITS CONDITION ITS STATION ONE IS OBLIGED TO GIVE EXPLANATIONS UNDER THE FORMS OF SENSIBLE THINGS BECAUSE IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD ALL THAT EXISTS IS SENSIBLE FOR EXAMPLE GRIEF AND HAPPINESS ARE INTELLECTUAL THINGS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0010.flac,THIS IS AN INTELLECTUAL OR SPIRITUAL STATE TO EXPLAIN WHICH YOU ARE OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO SENSIBLE FIGURES ANOTHER EXAMPLE YOU SAY SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL MADE GREAT PROGRESS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0011.flac,THOUGH HE IS REMAINING IN THE SAME PLACE OR AGAIN SUCH A ONE'S POSITION WAS EXALTED ALTHOUGH LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HE WALKS UPON THE EARTH THIS EXALTATION AND THIS PROGRESS ARE SPIRITUAL STATES AND INTELLECTUAL REALITIES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0012.flac,BUT TO EXPLAIN THEM YOU ARE OBLIGED TO HAVE RECOURSE TO SENSIBLE FIGURES BECAUSE IN THE EXTERIOR WORLD THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS NOT SENSIBLE SO THE SYMBOL OF KNOWLEDGE IS LIGHT AND OF IGNORANCE DARKNESS BUT REFLECT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0013.flac,IS KNOWLEDGE SENSIBLE LIGHT OR IGNORANCE SENSIBLE DARKNESS NO THEY ARE MERELY SYMBOLS THESE ARE ONLY INTELLECTUAL STATES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0014.flac,BUT WHEN YOU DESIRE TO EXPRESS THEM OUTWARDLY YOU CALL KNOWLEDGE LIGHT AND IGNORANCE DARKNESS YOU SAY MY HEART WAS GLOOMY AND IT BECAME ENLIGHTENED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0015.flac,NOW THAT LIGHT OF KNOWLEDGE AND THAT DARKNESS OF IGNORANCE ARE INTELLECTUAL REALITIES NOT SENSIBLE ONES BUT WHEN WE SEEK FOR EXPLANATIONS IN THE EXTERNAL WORLD WE ARE OBLIGED TO GIVE THEM A SENSIBLE FORM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0016.flac,THEN IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE DOVE WHICH DESCENDED UPON CHRIST WAS NOT A MATERIAL DOVE BUT IT WAS A SPIRITUAL STATE WHICH THAT IT MIGHT BE COMPREHENSIBLE WAS EXPRESSED BY A SENSIBLE FIGURE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0017.flac,THUS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT IT IS SAID THAT GOD APPEARED AS A PILLAR OF FIRE THIS DOES NOT SIGNIFY THE MATERIAL FORM IT IS AN INTELLECTUAL REALITY WHICH IS EXPRESSED BY A SENSIBLE IMAGE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0018.flac,A SIMILE A METAPHOR AND IS NOT TO BE ACCEPTED LITERALLY IT IS NOT A STATE THAT CAN BE COMPREHENDED BY MAN SLEEPING AND WAKING IS PASSING FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER SLEEPING IS THE CONDITION OF REPOSE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6385/220959/6385-220959-0019.flac,AND WAKEFULNESS IS THE CONDITION OF MOVEMENT SLEEPING IS THE STATE OF SILENCE

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6476/57446/6476-57446-0079.flac,BUT THAT IF HE KILLED HER CHILDREN SHE WOULD DESTROY HERSELF RATHER THAN YIELD TO HIS DESIRE WHEN HE HEARD THIS KIYOMORI BEWILDERED BY THE BEAUTY OF TOKIWA SPARED THE LIVES OF HER CHILDREN BUT BANISHED THEM FROM THE CAPITAL
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6476/57446/6476-57446-0080.flac,AND WHEN HE GREW UP AND BECAME A MAN HE MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF A PEASANT AFTER A WHILE YORITOMO LEFT THE PROVINCE AND WENT TO THE WARS LEAVING HIS WIFE PREGNANT AND IN DUE TIME SHE WAS DELIVERED OF A MALE CHILD

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6476/57446/6476-57446-0083.flac,AND YORITOMO BECAME THE CHIEF OF ALL THE NOBLE HOUSES IN JAPAN AND FIRST ESTABLISHED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY WHEN YORITOMO HAD THUS RAISED HIMSELF TO POWER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6476/57446/6476-57446-0084.flac,AND HIS DESCENDANTS AFTER HIM LIVED AS PEASANTS IN THE SAME VILLAGE INCREASING IN PROSPERITY AND IN GOOD REPUTE AMONG THEIR NEIGHBOURS BUT THE PRINCELY LINE OF YORITOMO CAME TO AN END IN THREE GENERATIONS

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6529/62554/6529-62554-0023.flac,WE WILL SEARCH INTO ITS MOST SECRET RECESSES AND WILL HOPE THAT OUR UNKNOWN FRIEND WILL PARDON US IN CONSIDERATION OF OUR INTENTIONS FOR SEVERAL DAYS THE COLONISTS WERE ACTIVELY EMPLOYED IN HAYMAKING AND THE HARVEST
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6529/62554/6529-62554-0024.flac,BEFORE PUTTING THEIR PROJECT OF EXPLORING THE YET UNKNOWN PARTS OF THE ISLAND INTO EXECUTION THEY WISHED TO GET ALL POSSIBLE WORK FINISHED IT WAS ALSO THE TIME FOR COLLECTING THE VARIOUS VEGETABLES FROM THE TABOR ISLAND PLANTS ALL WAS STOWED AWAY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6529/62554/6529-62554-0025.flac,AND HAPPILY THERE WAS NO WANT OF ROOM IN GRANITE HOUSE IN WHICH THEY MIGHT HAVE HOUSED ALL THE TREASURES OF THE ISLAND THE PRODUCTS OF THE COLONY WERE THERE METHODICALLY ARRANGED AND IN A SAFE PLACE AS MAY BE BELIEVED SHELTERED AS MUCH FROM ANIMALS AS FROM MAN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6529/62554/6529-62554-0026.flac,THERE WAS NO FEAR OF DAMP IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT THICK MASS OF GRANITE MANY NATURAL EXCAVATIONS SITUATED IN THE UPPER PASSAGE WERE ENLARGED EITHER BY PICK AXE OR MINE AND GRANITE HOUSE THUS BECAME A GENERAL WAREHOUSE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6529/62554/6529-62554-0027.flac,CONTAINING ALL THE PROVISIONS ARMS TOOLS AND SPARE UTENSILS IN A WORD ALL THE STORES OF THE COLONY AS TO THE GUNS OBTAINED FROM THE BRIG THEY WERE PRETTY PIECES OF ORDNANCE WHICH AT PENCROFT'S ENTREATY

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6529/62554/6529-62554-0029.flac,IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING IF WE TRIED THE RANGE OF OUR GUNS DO YOU THINK THAT IS USEFUL ASKED THE ENGINEER IT IS MORE THAN USEFUL IT IS NECESSARY WITHOUT THAT HOW ARE WE TO KNOW TO WHAT DISTANCE WE CAN SEND ONE OF THOSE PRETTY SHOT WITH WHICH WE ARE PROVIDED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6529/62554/6529-62554-0030.flac,TRY THEM PENCROFT REPLIED THE ENGINEER HOWEVER I THINK THAT IN MAKING THE EXPERIMENT WE OUGHT TO EMPLOY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6529/62554/6529-62554-0031.flac,BUT THE PYROXYLE WHICH WILL NEVER FAIL US CAN THE CANNON SUPPORT THE SHOCK OF THE PYROXYLE ASKED THE REPORTER WHO WAS NOT LESS ANXIOUS THAN PENCROFT TO TRY THE ARTILLERY OF GRANITE HOUSE I BELIEVE SO HOWEVER ADDED THE ENGINEER WE WILL BE PRUDENT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6529/62554/6529-62554-0032.flac,THE TRANSIT DESCRIBED BY THE BALL OUGHT TO BE AS EXTENDED AS POSSIBLE AND THIS TENSION COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED UNDER THE CONDITION THAT THE PROJECTILE SHOULD BE IMPELLED WITH A VERY GREAT INITIAL VELOCITY NOW SAID HARDING TO HIS COMPANIONS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6529/62554/6529-62554-0033.flac,THE INITIAL VELOCITY IS IN PROPORTION TO THE QUANTITY OF POWDER USED IN THE FABRICATION OF THESE PIECES EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON EMPLOYING A METAL WITH THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE POWER OF RESISTANCE AND STEEL IS INCONTESTABLY THAT METAL OF ALL OTHERS WHICH RESISTS THE BEST
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6529/62554/6529-62554-0034.flac,I HAVE THEREFORE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT OUR GUNS WILL BEAR WITHOUT RISK THE EXPANSION OF THE PYROXYLE GAS AND WILL GIVE EXCELLENT RESULTS WE SHALL BE A GREAT DEAL MORE CERTAIN OF THAT WHEN WE HAVE TRIED THEM ANSWERED PENCROFT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6529/62554/6529-62554-0035.flac,IT IS UNNECESSARY TO SAY THAT THE FOUR CANNONS WERE IN PERFECT ORDER SINCE THEY HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE WATER THE SAILOR HAD BESTOWED GREAT CARE UPON THEM HOW MANY HOURS HE HAD SPENT IN RUBBING GREASING AND POLISHING THEM AND IN CLEANING THE MECHANISM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6529/62554/6529-62554-0036.flac,AND NOW THE PIECES WERE AS BRILLIANT AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ON BOARD A FRIGATE OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY ON THIS DAY THEREFORE IN PRESENCE OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COLONY INCLUDING MASTER JUP AND TOP THE FOUR CANNON WERE SUCCESSIVELY TRIED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6529/62554/6529-62554-0037.flac,THEY WERE CHARGED WITH PYROXYLE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ITS EXPLOSIVE POWER WHICH AS HAS BEEN SAID IS FOUR TIMES THAT OF ORDINARY POWDER THE PROJECTILE TO BE FIRED WAS CYLINDROCONIC PENCROFT HOLDING THE END OF THE QUICK MATCH
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6529/62554/6529-62554-0038.flac,SUCH A SHOT THE HONOR OF WHICH BELONGED TO HIS DEAR BOY THE THIRD SHOT AIMED THIS TIME AT THE DOWNS FORMING THE UPPER SIDE OF UNION BAY STRUCK THE SAND AT A DISTANCE OF FOUR MILES THEN HAVING RICOCHETED WAS LOST IN THE SEA IN A CLOUD OF SPRAY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/6529/62554/6529-62554-0039.flac,FOR THE FOURTH PIECE CYRUS HARDING SLIGHTLY INCREASED THE CHARGE SO AS TO TRY ITS EXTREME RANGE THEN ALL STANDING ASIDE FOR FEAR OF ITS BURSTING THE MATCH WAS LIGHTED BY MEANS OF A LONG CORD

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0060.flac,THEN THERE WAS A LIGHT AND SUDDEN TINY FLAMES IN THE DARK HE HAD EVIDENTLY GOT FUEL AND HAD STARTED A FIRE ON THE STONE SLAB AS THE FLAMES BRIGHTENED I WATCHED HIS RESTLESS FIGURE HE WAS NOT A YOUNG MAN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0061.flac,HE WAS SHORT THICK SET AND QUICK IN HIS MOVEMENTS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0062.flac,WHEN HE GOT DOWN AGAIN I SAW THAT A BUNDLE WAS SUSPENDED OVER THE FIRE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0063.flac,ONLY THE SMOKE CURLED ABOUT IT THEN THE MAN MOVED THE WOODEN BLOCK TO THE SIDE OF THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN FACING US THE FLICKERING FLAMES THROWING A RED GLOW OVER HIM WIGAN DO YOU SEE WHISPERED QUARLES NOT CLEARLY WE'LL GO NEARER CAREFULLY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0064.flac,FROM OUR NEW POINT OF VIEW I LOOKED AGAIN THE MAN'S FACE WAS FAMILIAR BUT JUST THEN I COULD NOT REMEMBER WHO HE WAS IT WAS THE BUNDLE HANGING OVER THE FIRE WHICH FASCINATED ME TIED TOGETHER AND SECURED IN A NETWORK OF STRING
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0065.flac,WERE FIVE OR SIX HUMAN HEADS BLACKENED SHRIVELED FACES WHICH SEEMED TO GRIN HORRIBLY AS THEY SWUNG DEEPLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE LIT UP BY THE FLICKER OF THE FLAMES DO YOU SEE WIGAN QUARLES ASKED AGAIN YES

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0068.flac,AND I WAITED EXPECTING SOME FURTHER REVELATION LISTENING FOR OTHER FOOTSTEPS NONE CAME THE FIRE FLICKERED LOWER AND WENT OUT THE MOON HAD SET AND THE COLD OF THE EARLY MORNING GOT INTO MY BONES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0069.flac,IN THE DARKNESS BEFORE THE DAWN THE MAN MOVED ABOUT THE SHED AGAIN AND PRESENTLY I HEARD HIM GO PATIENCE WHISPERED QUARLES AS I STARTED UP TO GO AFTER HIM HE WILL NOT RUN AWAY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0070.flac,MY DEAR WIGAN HE SAID WHEN AT LAST HE CONDESCENDED TO TALK IT WAS ZENA WHO FIRST SET ME ON THE RIGHT ROAD WHEN SHE REMARKED THAT A MAN WHO HAD WALKED IN A DITCH CARRYING A BAG WOULD ARREST ATTENTION TWO POINTS WERE SUGGESTED FIRST
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0071.flac,THAT THE MAN MIGHT NOT HAVE FAR TO GO TO REACH A PLACE OF SAFETY SECONDLY THAT HE HAD COME PREPARED TO TAKE A HEAD AWAY WITH HIM A MERE SPECULATION YOU MAY SAY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0072.flac,WHY SHOULD A HEAD BE REQUIRED WHAT KIND OF MAN WOULD BE LIKELY TO WANT A HEAD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0073.flac,I SOUGHT FOR SOME PECULIARITY IN HIS MANNER AND FOUND NONE YET HIS HISTORY COINCIDED WITH MY THEORY YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM I SUPPOSE NOTHING RATHER AN INTERESTING CAREER BUT WITH AN HEREDITARY TAINT IN IT QUARLES WENT ON
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0074.flac,HIS MOTHER WAS ECCENTRIC HER HUSBAND WAS RICH ENOUGH TO HAVE HER LOOKED AFTER AT HOME HAD SHE BEEN A POORER PERSON SHE WOULD HAVE DIED IN A MADHOUSE RELIGIOUS MANIA HERS WAS AND HER SON HAS INHERITED IT IN A CURIOUS FASHION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0075.flac,HOW HAVE YOU LEARNT ALL THIS HE IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO HAVE SOME OF HIS DOINGS CHRONICLED AND HE WROTE SOME INTERESTING ARTICLES FOR A COUNTRY GENTLEMEN'S NEWSPAPER ABOUT HIS NORMANDY TOUR NATURE STUDIES AND SUCH LIKE ANOTHER POINT BOTH THESE MURDERS HAPPENED AT THE TIME OF THE FULL MOON
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0076.flac,I AM NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE BUT I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT FOR THE LAST HALF DOZEN YEARS SIR HENRY HAS NOT BEEN IN ENGLAND IN JANUARY YOU THINK I THINK THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHER HEADS MISSING IF HE HAD BEEN QUARLES ANSWERED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0077.flac,HE WAS SANE ENOUGH TO BE SOMEWHERE WHERE HE WAS NOT KNOWN WHEN THIS TIME OF THE YEAR CAME ROUND AT THE FULL MOON HE IS ALWAYS QUEER WITNESS LAST NIGHT BUT HE IS ONLY DANGEROUS IN JANUARY DANGEROUS I MEAN WITHOUT PROVOCATION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0078.flac,TO PRESERVE HIS SECRET I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT HE WOULD GO TO ANY LENGTH THAT IS WHY I WARNED YOU TO BE READY TO SHOOT WHEN WE WENT UPON OUR JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY NOW THIS YEAR HE WAS IN ENGLAND ILLNESS HAD KEPT HIM TO HIS HOUSE YONDER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0079.flac,AND THE INSANE DESIRE PROVED IRRESISTIBLE HE WAS CUNNING TOO HE MUST KNOW EVERYBODY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD YET THE MAN HE KILLED WAS UNKNOWN WE SHALL FIND PRESENTLY I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE VICTIM WAS SOME WANDERER RETURNING UNEXPECTEDLY TO FRIENDS IN WITHAN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0080.flac,SIR HENRY WAITING IN THE WOOD PERHAPS FOR HOURS MAY HAVE ALLOWED OTHERS TO PASS BEFORE THIS MAN CAME HE REALIZED THAT HE WAS A STRANGER AND ATTACKED HIM BUT THE HEAD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0081.flac,WAS AMONG THOSE HANGING OVER THE FIRE SIR HENRY WAS FOR MANY YEARS IN BORNEO WIGAN AND FOR A LARGE PART OF THE TIME WAS UP COUNTRY HELPING TO PUT DOWN THE HEAD HUNTING WHICH STILL EXISTED THERE AND STILL DOES EXIST ACCORDING TO ALL ACCOUNTS WHEN THE NATIVES THINK THEY CAN ESCAPE DETECTION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0082.flac,THE HORRIBLE CUSTOM PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIS DISEASED BRAIN AND FASCINATED HIM YOU SEE HOW MY THEORY GREW THEN I LOOKED FOR THE ACTUAL PROOF WHICH WE FOUND LAST NIGHT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90542/7190-90542-0083.flac,THE ARREST OF SIR HENRY BUCKINGHAM CAUSED AN ENORMOUS SENSATION HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PUT INTO A LUNATIC ASYLUM WHERE HE DIED NOT MANY MONTHS AFTERWARD FORTUNATELY HE HAD NO CHILDREN TO RUN THE RISK OF MADNESS IN THEIR TURN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0000.flac,HOWEVER OBSCURE A MYSTERY MAY BE THERE IS ALWAYS SOME POINT OR CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IF RIGHTLY INTERPRETED WILL LEAD TO ITS SOLUTION EVEN IN THOSE CRIMES WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN ELUCIDATED THIS POINT EXISTS ONLY IT HAS NEVER BEEN DULY APPRECIATED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0001.flac,FOR WHICH THE DETECTIVE FIRST LOOKS AND SINCE FEW CRIMES IF ANY ARE COMMITTED WITHOUT SOME DEFINITE REASON IT IS MOST FREQUENTLY FOUND IN THE MOTIVE HIS ALMOST SUPERHUMAN POWER OF RECOGNIZING THIS KEY CLEW WAS THE FOUNDATION OF CHRISTOPHER QUARLES'S SUCCESS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0002.flac,AND HIS SOLUTION OF THE MYSTERIOUS BURGLARIES WHICH CAUSED SUCH SPECULATION FOR A TIME WAS NOT THE LEAST OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS SIR JOSEPH MAYNARD THE EMINENT PHYSICIAN OF HARLEY STREET HAD GIVEN A SMALL DINNER PARTY ONE EVENING THE GUESTS LEFT EARLY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0003.flac,AND SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT THE HOUSEHOLD HAD RETIRED NEITHER SIR JOSEPH NOR LADY MAYNARD NOR ANY OF THE SERVANTS WERE DISTURBED DURING THE NIGHT BUT NEXT MORNING IT WAS FOUND THAT BURGLARS HAD ENTERED THEY HAD GOT IN BY A PASSAGE WINDOW AT THE BACK
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0004.flac,NOT A VERY DIFFICULT MATTER AND HAD EVIDENTLY GONE TO THE DINING ROOM AND HELPED THEMSELVES TO SPIRITS FROM A TANTALUS WHICH WAS ON THE SIDEBOARD THREE GLASSES WITH A LITTLE OF THE LIQUOR LEFT IN THEM WERE ON THE TABLE AND NEAR THEM WERE SOME BISCUIT CRUMBS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0005.flac,THERE WERE SEVERAL SILVER ARTICLES ON THE SIDEBOARD BUT THESE HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED THE BURGLARS APPEARED TO HAVE GIVEN ALL THEIR ATTENTION TO SIR JOSEPH'S ROOM WHICH WAS IN A STATE OF CONFUSION TWO CUPBOARDS AND EVERY DRAWER HAD BEEN TURNED OUT AND THE CONTENTS THROWN ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0006.flac,BUT OF AN OLD FASHIONED TYPE PRESENTING LITTLE DIFFICULTY TO EXPERTS IN IT BESIDES PAPERS AND ABOUT SEVENTY POUNDS IN GOLD IN A CANVAS BAG
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0007.flac,PRESENTATIONS WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM AND SOME UNIQUE SPECIMENS OF THE QUEEN ANNE PERIOD ALL THIS SILVER WAS UPON THE FLOOR ALSO THE BAG OF MONEY INTACT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0008.flac,IT LOOKED AS IF THE BOX HAD BEEN KNOCKED DOWN AND TRODDEN ON BY MISTAKE FOR THE COUNTERS WERE IN A LITTLE HEAP CLOSE TO THE BROKEN FRAGMENTS IT APPEARED THAT THE BURGLARS MUST HAVE BEEN DISTURBED AND HAD MADE OFF WITHOUT SECURING THEIR BOOTY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0009.flac,THIS WAS THE OBVIOUS EXPLANATION BUT IT DID NOT SATISFY ME I QUESTIONED SIR JOSEPH ABOUT HIS PAPERS HAD HE ANY DOCUMENT WHICH FOR PRIVATE OR PUBLIC REASONS SOMEONE MIGHT BE ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN HE SAID HE HAD NOT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0010.flac,WAS INCLINED TO LAUGH AT MY QUESTION AND PROCEEDED TO INFORM ME THAT HE HAD NO FAMILY SKELETON
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0011.flac,HAD NEVER BEEN IN TOUCH WITH ANY MYSTERIOUS SOCIETY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0012.flac,BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN POINTS AGAINST THIS IDEA NO ONE HAD MOVED ABOUT THE HOUSE DURING THE NIGHT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0013.flac,THE SILVER ON THE FLOOR WAS SCATTERED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0014.flac,AND IT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN THROWN ASIDE CARELESSLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NOT WHAT THE THIEVES WERE IN SEARCH OF AND SURELY HAD THEY LEFT IN A HURRY THE BAG OF MONEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0015.flac,MOREOVER THE CIGARETTE ENDS AND THE DIRTY GLASSES SUGGESTED A CERTAIN LEISURELY METHOD OF GOING TO WORK AND MEN OF THIS KIND WOULD NOT BE EASILY FRIGHTENED THE CIGARETTE ENDS PUZZLED ME THEY WERE OF A CHEAP AMERICAN BRAND
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0016.flac,HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN FROM SIR JOSEPH'S BOX WHICH CONTAINED ONLY TURKISH ONES AND ALTHOUGH THEY HAD APPARENTLY BEEN THROWN DOWN CARELESSLY THERE WAS NO ASH UPON THE CARPET NOR ANYWHERE ELSE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0017.flac,IF MY IDEA WERE CORRECT IT WOULD MEAN THAT THEY HAD BEEN PUT THERE ON PURPOSE TO MISLEAD I EXAMINED THE THREE GLASSES ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE THERE WAS THE STAIN OF LIPS AT THE RIM OF ONE BUT NOT OF THE OTHER TWO ONLY ONE HAD BEEN DRUNK OUT OF
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0018.flac,AND PROBABLY A LITTLE OF THE LIQUID HAD BEEN EMPTIED OUT OF THIS INTO THE OTHER TWO ON INQUIRY ONE OF THE SERVANTS TOLD ME THAT ONLY A VERY LITTLE OF THE SPIRIT HAD BEEN TAKEN SHE ALSO SAID THERE WAS ONLY ONE BISCUIT LEFT IN THE BOX LAST NIGHT AND IT WAS THERE NOW
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0019.flac,BY DOING SO I CERTAINLY SAVED ONE VALUABLE LIFE POSSIBLY MORE THAN ONE THAT HE WAS INTERESTED WAS SHOWN BY OUR ADJOURNMENT TO THE EMPTY ROOM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0020.flac,HE SAID I THINK THERE WAS ONLY ONE BURGLAR BUT FOR SOME REASON HE THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT THAT IT SHOULD BE BELIEVED THERE WERE MORE A VERY IMPORTANT POINT AND A REASONABLE CONCLUSION I FANCY SAID QUARLES IF YOU ARE RIGHT IT NARROWS THE SPHERE OF INQUIRY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0021.flac,NARROWS IT VERY MUCH TAKEN WITH THE OTHER FACTS OF THE CASE EXACTLY I ANSWERED THERE IS A SUGGESTION TO MY MIND OF AMATEURISHNESS IN THE AFFAIR I GRANT THE SAFE WAS NOT A DIFFICULT ONE TO BREAK OPEN BUT IT HAD NOT BEEN DONE IN A VERY EXPERT MANNER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0022.flac,THE CIGARETTE ENDS THE DIRTY GLASSES AND THE BISCUIT CRUMBS SEEM TO ME RATHER GRATUITOUS DECEPTIONS AND WAIT SAID QUARLES YOU ASSUME A LITTLE TOO MUCH THEY WOULD HAVE DECEIVED NINE MEN OUT OF TEN YOU HAPPEN TO BE THE TENTH MAN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0023.flac,AMATEUR OR NOT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH A VERY SMART MAN SO DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE ENEMY WIGAN ASSUMING THIS TO BE THE WORK OF AN AMATEUR TO WHAT DEFINITE POINT DOES IT LEAD YOU TO THIS QUESTION I REPLIED DID SIR JOSEPH MAYNARD BURGLE HIS OWN HOUSE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7190/90543/7190-90543-0024.flac,WHY SHOULD YOU THINK SO HIS MANNER WAS CURIOUS THEN THERE IS ONLY HIS OWN STATEMENT THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN TAKEN BUT SUPPOSING HE WISHED TO GET RID OF PAPERS OR

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92310/7264-92310-0001.flac,THE CAPITALIST OWNING THE SHEET WOULD NECESSARILY CONSIDER HIS REVENUE FROM ADVERTISEMENT BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE HE WAS INDEED COMPELLED TO DO SO UNLESS HE HAD ENORMOUS REVENUES FROM OTHER SOURCES AND RAN HIS PAPER AS A LUXURY COSTING A VAST FORTUNE A YEAR
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92310/7264-92310-0002.flac,FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY THE RULE IS EITHER VERY GREAT PROFITS OR VERY GREAT AND RAPID LOSSES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92310/7264-92310-0003.flac,WHERE A GREAT DAILY PAPER IS CONCERNED HE WAS COMPELLED THEN TO RESPECT HIS ADVERTISERS AS HIS PAYMASTERS TO THAT EXTENT THEREFORE HIS POWER OF GIVING TRUE NEWS AND OF PRINTING SOUND OPINION WAS LIMITED EVEN THOUGH HIS OWN INCLINATIONS SHOULD LEAN TOWARDS SUCH NEWS AND SUCH OPINION

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92314/7264-92314-0017.flac,THE RESULT IS THAT THE MASS OF ENGLISHMEN HAVE CEASED TO OBTAIN OR EVEN TO EXPECT INFORMATION UPON THE WAY THEY ARE GOVERNED THEY ARE BEGINNING TO FEEL A CERTAIN UNEASINESS THEY KNOW THAT THEIR OLD POWER OF OBSERVATION OVER PUBLIC SERVANTS HAS SLIPPED FROM THEM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92314/7264-92314-0018.flac,THEY SUSPECT THAT THE KNOWN GROSS CORRUPTION OF PUBLIC LIFE AND PARTICULARLY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IS ENTRENCHED BEHIND A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE ON THE PART OF THOSE VERY FEW WHO HAVE THE POWER TO INFORM THEM BUT AS YET THEY HAVE NOT PASSED THE STAGE OF SUCH SUSPICION

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0003.flac,THE ORGANS OF OPINION PROFESSED A GENTEEL IGNORANCE OF THAT IDEA WHICH WAS MOST WIDESPREAD MOST INTENSE AND MOST FORMATIVE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0004.flac,THERE WAS NOTHING TO DISTINGUISH A LARGE DAILY PAPER OWNED BY A JEW FROM ONE OWNED BY AN AGNOSTIC OR A CATHOLIC NECESSITY OF EXPRESSION COMPELLED THE CREATION OF A FREE PRESS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ONE MOTIVE OF RELIGION MEN CAME ACROSS VERY LITTLE OF THIS IN ENGLAND
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0005.flac,BECAUSE ENGLAND WAS FOR LONG VIRTUALLY HOMOGENEOUS IN RELIGION AND THAT RELIGION WAS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC DURING THE YEARS IN WHICH THE FREE PRESS AROSE BUT SUCH A FREE PRESS IN DEFENCE OF RELIGION THE PIONEER OF ALL THE FREE PRESS AROSE IN IRELAND AND IN FRANCE AND ELSEWHERE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0006.flac,BUT IT ASSERTED THE NECESSITY OF SPECIALLY EMPHASIZING ITS PARTICULAR POINT OF VIEW IN ITS OWN COLUMNS FOR RELIGION AFFECTS ALL LIFE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0007.flac,A GENERATION AGO AND MORE GREAT NUMBERS OF MEN WERE PERSUADED THAT A SOLUTION FOR THE WHOLE COMPLEX OF SOCIAL INJUSTICE WAS TO BE FOUND IN WHAT THEY CALLED NATIONALIZING THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0008.flac,THAT IS OF COURSE IN PLAIN ENGLISH PUTTING LAND HOUSES AND MACHINERY AND STORES OF FOOD AND CLOTHING INTO THE HANDS OF THE POLITICIANS FOR CONTROL IN USE AND FOR DISTRIBUTION IN CONSUMPTION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0009.flac,THIS CREED WAS HELD WITH PASSIONATE CONVICTION BY MEN OF THE HIGHEST ABILITY IN EVERY COUNTRY OF EUROPE AND A SOCIALIST PRESS BEGAN TO ARISE WHICH WAS EVERYWHERE FREE AND SOON IN ACTIVE OPPOSITION TO THE OFFICIAL PRESS

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0015.flac,HAD CAPTURED THE WHOLE FIELD THE FIRST PROPAGANDISTS THEN DID NOT STAND UP TO THE OFFICIAL PRESS AS EQUALS THEY CREPT IN AS INFERIORS OR RATHER AS OPEN EX CENTRICS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0016.flac,FOR VICTORIAN ENGLAND AND THIRD EMPIRE FRANCE FALSELY PROCLAIMED THE REPRESENTATIVE QUALITY OF THE OFFICIAL PRESS TO THE HONOUR OF THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT THE SOCIALIST FREE PRESS WAS THE FIRST TO STAND UP AS AN EQUAL AGAINST THE GIANTS

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0018.flac,BUT I NOW KNOW THAT THESE SMALL SOCIALIST FREE PAPERS WERE TALKING THE PLAINEST COMMON SENSE WHEN THEY SPECIFICALLY EMPHASIZED AS CAPITALIST THE FALSEHOODS AND SUPPRESSIONS OF THEIR GREAT CONTEMPORARIES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0019.flac,FROM THE SOCIALIST POINT OF VIEW THE LEADING FACT ABOUT THE INSINCERITY OF THE GREAT OFFICIAL PAPERS IS THAT THIS INSINCERITY IS CAPITALIST JUST AS FROM A CATHOLIC POINT OF VIEW THE LEADING FACT ABOUT IT WAS AND IS THAT IT IS ANTI CATHOLIC
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0020.flac,THOUGH HOWEVER CERTAIN OF THE SOCIALIST FREE PAPERS THUS BOLDLY TOOK UP A STANDPOINT OF MORAL EQUALITY WITH THE OTHERS THEIR ATTITUDE WAS EXCEPTIONAL

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0024.flac,WE MAY TAKE IT THEN THAT PROPAGANDA WAS IN ORDER OF TIME THE FIRST MOTIVE OF THE FREE PRESS AND THE FIRST CAUSE OF ITS PRODUCTION NOW FROM THIS FACT ARISES A CONSIDERATION OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO OUR SUBJECT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0025.flac,I MEAN THAT THE FREE PRESS HAS HAD STAMPED UPON IT THE CHARACTER OF DISPARATE PARTICULARISM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0026.flac,BUT I KNOW THAT WHEREVER I GET HOLD OF SUCH AN ORGAN IT WILL BE VERY STRONGLY COLOURED WITH THE OPINION OR EVEN FANATICISM OF SOME MINORITY THE FREE PRESS AS A WHOLE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0027.flac,IF YOU ADD IT ALL UP AND CANCEL OUT ONE EXAGGERATED STATEMENT AGAINST ANOTHER DOES GIVE YOU A TRUE VIEW OF THE STATE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH YOU LIVE THE OFFICIAL PRESS TO DAY GIVES YOU AN ABSURDLY FALSE ONE EVERYWHERE

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0029.flac,BECAUSE IT CAME LATER THAN THE OFFICIAL PRESS OF CAPITALISM AND WAS IN ITS ORIGINS BUT A REACTION AGAINST IT B THE SECOND MOTIVE THAT OF INDIGNATION AGAINST FALSEHOOD CAME TO WORK MUCH LATER THAN THE MOTIVE OF PROPAGANDA

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0032.flac,BUT IT WAS A SORT OF DUAL ARRANGEMENT WHICH YET MODIFIED THE POWER OF THE VULGAR OWNER I MYSELF REMEMBER THAT STATE OF AFFAIRS THE EDITOR WHO WAS A GENTLEMAN AND DINED OUT THE PROPRIETOR WHO WAS A LORD AND NERVOUS WHEN HE MET A GENTLEMAN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7264/92316/7264-92316-0033.flac,THE EDITOR BECAME AND NOW IS A MERE MOUTHPIECE OF THE PROPRIETOR EDITORS SUCCEED EACH OTHER RAPIDLY OF GREAT PAPERS TO DAY THE EDITOR'S NAME OF THE MOMENT IS HARDLY KNOWN

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0001.flac,BY DEGREES I REMEMBER A STRONGER LIGHT PRESSED UPON MY NERVES SO THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SHUT MY EYES DARKNESS THEN CAME OVER ME AND TROUBLED ME BUT HARDLY HAD I FELT THIS WHEN BY OPENING MY EYES AS I NOW SUPPOSE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0002.flac,THE LIGHT POURED IN UPON ME AGAIN I WALKED AND I BELIEVE DESCENDED BUT I PRESENTLY FOUND A GREAT ALTERATION IN MY SENSATIONS BEFORE DARK AND OPAQUE BODIES HAD SURROUNDED ME
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0003.flac,THE LIGHT BECAME MORE AND MORE OPPRESSIVE TO ME
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0004.flac,THIS WAS THE FOREST NEAR INGOLSTADT AND HERE I LAY BY THE SIDE OF A BROOK RESTING FROM MY FATIGUE UNTIL I FELT TORMENTED BY HUNGER AND THIRST THIS ROUSED ME FROM MY NEARLY DORMANT STATE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0005.flac,I SLAKED MY THIRST AT THE BROOK AND THEN LYING DOWN WAS OVERCOME BY SLEEP IT WAS DARK WHEN I AWOKE I FELT COLD ALSO AND HALF FRIGHTENED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0006.flac,AS IT WERE INSTINCTIVELY FINDING MYSELF SO DESOLATE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0007.flac,I HAD COVERED MYSELF WITH SOME CLOTHES BUT THESE WERE INSUFFICIENT TO SECURE ME FROM THE DEWS OF NIGHT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0008.flac,I KNEW AND COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING BUT FEELING PAIN INVADE ME ON ALL SIDES I SAT DOWN AND WEPT SOON A GENTLE LIGHT STOLE OVER THE HEAVENS AND GAVE ME A SENSATION OF PLEASURE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0009.flac,THE MOON I GAZED WITH A KIND OF WONDER IT MOVED SLOWLY BUT IT ENLIGHTENED MY PATH AND I AGAIN WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF BERRIES I WAS STILL COLD WHEN UNDER ONE OF THE TREES I FOUND A HUGE CLOAK
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0010.flac,NO DISTINCT IDEAS OCCUPIED MY MIND ALL WAS CONFUSED I FELT LIGHT AND HUNGER AND THIRST AND DARKNESS INNUMERABLE SOUNDS RANG IN MY EARS AND ON ALL SIDES VARIOUS SCENTS SALUTED ME
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0011.flac,THE ONLY OBJECT THAT I COULD DISTINGUISH WAS THE BRIGHT MOON AND I FIXED MY EYES ON THAT WITH PLEASURE SEVERAL CHANGES OF DAY AND NIGHT PASSED AND THE ORB OF NIGHT HAD GREATLY LESSENED WHEN I BEGAN TO DISTINGUISH MY SENSATIONS FROM EACH OTHER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0012.flac,I GRADUALLY SAW PLAINLY THE CLEAR STREAM THAT SUPPLIED ME WITH DRINK AND THE TREES THAT SHADED ME WITH THEIR FOLIAGE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0013.flac,WHICH OFTEN SALUTED MY EARS PROCEEDED FROM THE THROATS OF THE LITTLE WINGED ANIMALS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0014.flac,AND TO PERCEIVE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE RADIANT ROOF
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0015.flac,SOMETIMES I TRIED TO IMITATE THE PLEASANT SONGS OF THE BIRDS BUT WAS UNABLE SOMETIMES I WISHED TO EXPRESS MY SENSATIONS IN MY OWN MODE BUT THE UNCOUTH AND INARTICULATE SOUNDS WHICH BROKE FROM ME FRIGHTENED ME INTO SILENCE AGAIN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0016.flac,THE MOON HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE NIGHT AND AGAIN WITH A LESSENED FORM SHOWED ITSELF WHILE I STILL REMAINED IN THE FOREST MY SENSATIONS HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME DISTINCT AND MY MIND RECEIVED EVERY DAY ADDITIONAL IDEAS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0017.flac,MY EYES BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE LIGHT AND TO PERCEIVE OBJECTS IN THEIR RIGHT FORMS I DISTINGUISHED THE INSECT FROM THE HERB AND BY DEGREES ONE HERB FROM ANOTHER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0018.flac,ONE DAY WHEN I WAS OPPRESSED BY COLD I FOUND A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY SOME WANDERING BEGGARS AND WAS OVERCOME WITH DELIGHT AT THE WARMTH I EXPERIENCED FROM IT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0019.flac,IN MY JOY I THRUST MY HAND INTO THE LIVE EMBERS BUT QUICKLY DREW IT OUT AGAIN WITH A CRY OF PAIN HOW STRANGE I THOUGHT THAT THE SAME CAUSE SHOULD PRODUCE SUCH OPPOSITE EFFECTS I EXAMINED THE MATERIALS OF THE FIRE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0020.flac,THE WET WOOD WHICH I HAD PLACED NEAR THE HEAT DRIED AND ITSELF BECAME INFLAMED I REFLECTED ON THIS AND BY TOUCHING THE VARIOUS BRANCHES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0021.flac,AND THEN SPREADING MY CLOAK I LAY ON THE GROUND AND SANK INTO SLEEP IT WAS MORNING WHEN I AWOKE AND MY FIRST CARE WAS TO VISIT THE FIRE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0022.flac,I OBSERVED THIS ALSO
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0023.flac,WHEN THEY WERE NEARLY EXTINGUISHED WHEN NIGHT CAME AGAIN I FOUND WITH PLEASURE THAT THE FIRE GAVE LIGHT AS WELL AS HEAT AND THAT THE DISCOVERY OF THIS ELEMENT WAS USEFUL TO ME IN MY FOOD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0024.flac,AND TASTED MUCH MORE SAVOURY THAN THE BERRIES I GATHERED FROM THE TREES I TRIED THEREFORE TO DRESS MY FOOD IN THE SAME MANNER PLACING IT ON THE LIVE EMBERS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0025.flac,AND THE NUTS AND ROOTS MUCH IMPROVED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0026.flac,WHEN I FOUND THIS I RESOLVED TO QUIT THE PLACE THAT I HAD HITHERTO INHABITED TO SEEK FOR ONE WHERE THE FEW WANTS I EXPERIENCED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0027.flac,AND KNEW NOT HOW TO REPRODUCE IT I GAVE SEVERAL HOURS TO THE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION OF THIS DIFFICULTY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0028.flac,I STRUCK ACROSS THE WOOD TOWARDS THE SETTING SUN I PASSED THREE DAYS IN THESE RAMBLES AND AT LENGTH DISCOVERED THE OPEN COUNTRY A GREAT FALL OF SNOW HAD TAKEN PLACE THE NIGHT BEFORE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0029.flac,THE APPEARANCE WAS DISCONSOLATE AND I FOUND MY FEET CHILLED BY THE COLD DAMP SUBSTANCE THAT COVERED THE GROUND IT WAS ABOUT SEVEN IN THE MORNING AND I LONGED TO OBTAIN FOOD AND SHELTER AT LENGTH I PERCEIVED A SMALL HUT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0030.flac,THIS WAS A NEW SIGHT TO ME AND I EXAMINED THE STRUCTURE WITH GREAT CURIOSITY FINDING THE DOOR OPEN I ENTERED AN OLD MAN SAT IN IT NEAR A FIRE OVER WHICH HE WAS PREPARING HIS BREAKFAST HE TURNED ON HEARING A NOISE AND PERCEIVING ME SHRIEKED LOUDLY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0031.flac,HIS APPEARANCE DIFFERENT FROM ANY I HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN AND HIS FLIGHT SOMEWHAT SURPRISED ME
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0032.flac,AFTER THEIR SUFFERINGS IN THE LAKE OF FIRE I GREEDILY DEVOURED THE REMNANTS OF THE SHEPHERD'S BREAKFAST WHICH CONSISTED OF BREAD CHEESE MILK AND WINE THE LATTER HOWEVER I DID NOT LIKE THEN OVERCOME
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0033.flac,I LAY DOWN AMONG SOME STRAW AND FELL ASLEEP
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0034.flac,WHICH SHONE BRIGHTLY ON THE WHITE GROUND
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0035.flac,I PROCEEDED ACROSS THE FIELDS FOR SEVERAL HOURS UNTIL AT SUNSET I ARRIVED AT A VILLAGE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0036.flac,ALLURED MY APPETITE ONE OF THE BEST OF THESE I ENTERED BUT I HAD HARDLY PLACED MY FOOT WITHIN THE DOOR BEFORE THE CHILDREN SHRIEKED AND ONE OF THE WOMEN FAINTED THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS ROUSED SOME FLED SOME ATTACKED ME
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0037.flac,REFUGE IN A LOW HOVEL QUITE BARE AND MAKING A WRETCHED APPEARANCE AFTER THE PALACES I HAD BEHELD IN THE VILLAGE THIS HOVEL HOWEVER JOINED A COTTAGE OF A NEAT AND PLEASANT APPEARANCE BUT AFTER MY LATE DEARLY BOUGHT EXPERIENCE I DARED NOT ENTER IT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0038.flac,NO WOOD HOWEVER WAS PLACED ON THE EARTH WHICH FORMED THE FLOOR BUT IT WAS DRY AND ALTHOUGH THE WIND ENTERED IT BY INNUMERABLE CHINKS I FOUND IT AN AGREEABLE ASYLUM FROM THE SNOW AND RAIN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0039.flac,HOWEVER MISERABLE FROM THE INCLEMENCY OF THE SEASON AND STILL MORE FROM THE BARBARITY OF MAN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0040.flac,THAT I MIGHT VIEW THE ADJACENT COTTAGE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0041.flac,ONE PART WAS OPEN AND BY THAT I HAD CREPT IN BUT NOW I COVERED EVERY CREVICE BY WHICH I MIGHT BE PERCEIVED WITH STONES AND WOOD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0042.flac,ALL THE LIGHT I ENJOYED CAME THROUGH THE STY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0043.flac,HAVING THUS ARRANGED MY DWELLING AND CARPETED IT WITH CLEAN STRAW I RETIRED FOR I SAW THE FIGURE OF A MAN AT A DISTANCE AND I REMEMBERED TOO WELL MY TREATMENT THE NIGHT BEFORE TO TRUST MYSELF IN HIS POWER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0044.flac,BY A LOAF OF COARSE BREAD WHICH I PURLOINED AND A CUP
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0045.flac,WHICH FLOWED BY MY RETREAT THE FLOOR WAS A LITTLE RAISED SO THAT IT WAS KEPT PERFECTLY DRY AND BY ITS VICINITY TO THE CHIMNEY OF THE COTTAGE IT WAS TOLERABLY WARM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0046.flac,THE RAIN DROPPING BRANCHES AND DANK EARTH I ATE MY BREAKFAST WITH PLEASURE AND WAS ABOUT TO REMOVE A PLANK TO PROCURE MYSELF A LITTLE WATER WHEN I HEARD A STEP AND LOOKING THROUGH A SMALL CHINK I BEHELD A YOUNG CREATURE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0047.flac,WITH A PAIL ON HER HEAD PASSING BEFORE MY HOVEL THE GIRL WAS YOUNG AND OF GENTLE DEMEANOUR
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0048.flac,HER FAIR HAIR WAS PLAITED BUT NOT ADORNED SHE LOOKED PATIENT YET SAD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0049.flac,AND IN ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE RETURNED BEARING THE PAIL WHICH WAS NOW PARTLY FILLED WITH MILK AS SHE WALKED ALONG
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0050.flac,PRESENTLY I SAW THE YOUNG MAN AGAIN WITH SOME TOOLS IN HIS HAND CROSS THE FIELD BEHIND THE COTTAGE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0051.flac,ON EXAMINING MY DWELLING I FOUND THAT ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF THE COTTAGE HAD FORMERLY OCCUPIED A PART OF IT BUT THE PANES HAD BEEN FILLED UP WITH WOOD IN ONE OF THESE WAS A SMALL AND ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE CHINK THROUGH WHICH THE EYE COULD JUST PENETRATE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0052.flac,WHITEWASHED AND CLEAN BUT VERY BARE OF FURNITURE IN ONE CORNER NEAR A SMALL FIRE SAT AN OLD MAN LEANING HIS HEAD ON HIS HANDS IN A DISCONSOLATE ATTITUDE THE YOUNG GIRL WAS OCCUPIED IN ARRANGING THE COTTAGE BUT PRESENTLY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0053.flac,WHO TAKING UP AN INSTRUMENT BEGAN TO PLAY AND TO PRODUCE SOUNDS SWEETER THAN THE VOICE OF THE THRUSH OR THE NIGHTINGALE IT WAS A LOVELY SIGHT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0054.flac,THE SILVER HAIR AND BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF THE AGED COTTAGER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0055.flac,HE RAISED HER AND SMILED WITH SUCH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION THAT I FELT SENSATIONS OF A PECULIAR AND OVERPOWERING NATURE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0056.flac,AND I WITHDREW FROM THE WINDOW UNABLE TO BEAR THESE EMOTIONS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0057.flac,BEARING ON HIS SHOULDERS A LOAD OF WOOD THE GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR HELPED TO RELIEVE HIM OF HIS BURDEN AND TAKING SOME OF THE FUEL INTO THE COTTAGE PLACED IT ON THE FIRE THEN SHE AND THE YOUTH WENT APART INTO A NOOK OF THE COTTAGE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0058.flac,AND HE SHOWED HER A LARGE LOAF AND A PIECE OF CHEESE SHE SEEMED PLEASED AND WENT INTO THE GARDEN FOR SOME ROOTS AND PLANTS WHICH SHE PLACED IN WATER AND THEN UPON THE FIRE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0059.flac,AND APPEARED BUSILY EMPLOYED IN DIGGING AND PULLING UP ROOTS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0060.flac,THE OLD MAN HAD IN THE MEANTIME BEEN PENSIVE BUT ON THE APPEARANCE OF HIS COMPANIONS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0061.flac,THE MEAL WAS QUICKLY DISPATCHED THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS AGAIN OCCUPIED IN ARRANGING THE COTTAGE THE OLD MAN WALKED BEFORE THE COTTAGE IN THE SUN FOR A FEW MINUTES LEANING ON THE ARM OF THE YOUTH NOTHING COULD EXCEED IN BEAUTY THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THESE TWO EXCELLENT CREATURES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0062.flac,BUT TO MY EXTREME WONDER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0063.flac,DID NOT PUT AN END TO THE PLEASURE I EXPERIENCED IN WATCHING MY HUMAN NEIGHBOURS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/358/730-358-0064.flac,THE YOUTH BEGAN NOT TO PLAY BUT TO UTTER SOUNDS THAT WERE MONOTONOUS AND NEITHER RESEMBLING THE HARMONY OF THE OLD MAN'S INSTRUMENT NOR THE SONGS OF THE BIRDS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0000.flac,I LAY ON MY STRAW BUT I COULD NOT SLEEP I THOUGHT OF THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY WHAT CHIEFLY STRUCK ME WAS THE GENTLE MANNERS OF THESE PEOPLE AND I LONGED TO JOIN THEM BUT DARED NOT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0001.flac,WHICH INFLUENCED THEIR ACTIONS THE COTTAGERS AROSE THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE SUN THE YOUNG WOMAN ARRANGED THE COTTAGE AND PREPARED THE FOOD AND THE YOUTH DEPARTED AFTER THE FIRST MEAL
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0002.flac,THIS DAY WAS PASSED IN THE SAME ROUTINE AS THAT WHICH PRECEDED IT THE YOUNG MAN WAS CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED OUT OF DOORS AND THE GIRL IN VARIOUS LABORIOUS OCCUPATIONS WITHIN THE OLD MAN WHOM I SOON PERCEIVED TO BE BLIND
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0003.flac,EMPLOYED HIS LEISURE HOURS ON HIS INSTRUMENT OR IN CONTEMPLATION NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE LOVE AND RESPECT WHICH THE YOUNGER COTTAGERS EXHIBITED TOWARDS THEIR VENERABLE COMPANION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0004.flac,AND DUTY WITH GENTLENESS AND HE REWARDED THEM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0005.flac,THEY WERE NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY THE YOUNG MAN AND HIS COMPANION OFTEN WENT APART AND APPEARED TO WEEP I SAW NO CAUSE FOR THEIR UNHAPPINESS BUT I WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY IT IF SUCH LOVELY CREATURES WERE MISERABLE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0006.flac,IT WAS LESS STRANGE THAT I AN IMPERFECT AND SOLITARY BEING SHOULD BE WRETCHED YET WHY WERE THESE GENTLE BEINGS UNHAPPY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0007.flac,THEY WERE DRESSED IN EXCELLENT CLOTHES AND STILL MORE THEY ENJOYED ONE ANOTHER'S COMPANY AND SPEECH INTERCHANGING EACH DAY LOOKS OF AFFECTION AND KINDNESS WHAT DID THEIR TEARS IMPLY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0008.flac,A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD ELAPSED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0009.flac,IT WAS POVERTY AND THEY SUFFERED THAT EVIL IN A VERY DISTRESSING DEGREE THEIR NOURISHMENT CONSISTED ENTIRELY OF THE VEGETABLES OF THEIR GARDEN AND THE MILK OF ONE COW WHICH GAVE VERY LITTLE DURING THE WINTER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0010.flac,WHEN ITS MASTERS COULD SCARCELY PROCURE FOOD TO SUPPORT IT THEY OFTEN I BELIEVE SUFFERED THE PANGS OF HUNGER VERY POIGNANTLY ESPECIALLY THE TWO YOUNGER COTTAGERS FOR SEVERAL TIMES THEY PLACED FOOD BEFORE THE OLD MAN WHEN THEY RESERVED NONE FOR THEMSELVES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0011.flac,THIS TRAIT OF KINDNESS MOVED ME SENSIBLY I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED DURING THE NIGHT TO STEAL A PART OF THEIR STORE FOR MY OWN CONSUMPTION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0012.flac,I ABSTAINED AND SATISFIED MYSELF WITH BERRIES NUTS AND ROOTS WHICH I GATHERED FROM A NEIGHBOURING WOOD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0013.flac,AND BROUGHT HOME FIRING SUFFICIENT FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF SEVERAL DAYS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0014.flac,THE YOUNG WOMAN WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR IN THE MORNING
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0015.flac,SHE UTTERED SOME WORDS IN A LOUD VOICE AND THE YOUTH JOINED HER WHO ALSO EXPRESSED SURPRISE I OBSERVED WITH PLEASURE THAT HE DID NOT GO TO THE FOREST THAT DAY BUT SPENT IT IN REPAIRING THE COTTAGE AND CULTIVATING THE GARDEN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0016.flac,BY DEGREES I MADE A DISCOVERY OF STILL GREATER MOMENT I FOUND THAT THESE PEOPLE POSSESSED A METHOD OF COMMUNICATING THEIR EXPERIENCE AND FEELINGS TO ONE ANOTHER BY ARTICULATE SOUNDS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0017.flac,I PERCEIVED THAT THE WORDS THEY SPOKE SOMETIMES PRODUCED PLEASURE OR PAIN SMILES OR SADNESS IN THE MINDS AND COUNTENANCES OF THE HEARERS THIS WAS INDEED A GODLIKE SCIENCE AND I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH IT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0018.flac,BUT I WAS BAFFLED IN EVERY ATTEMPT I MADE FOR THIS PURPOSE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0019.flac,NOT HAVING ANY APPARENT CONNECTION WITH VISIBLE OBJECTS I WAS UNABLE TO DISCOVER ANY CLUE BY WHICH I COULD UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY OF THEIR REFERENCE BY GREAT APPLICATION HOWEVER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0020.flac,AND AFTER HAVING REMAINED DURING THE SPACE OF SEVERAL REVOLUTIONS OF THE MOON IN MY HOVEL I DISCOVERED THE NAMES THAT WERE GIVEN TO SOME OF THE MOST FAMILIAR OBJECTS OF DISCOURSE I LEARNED AND APPLIED THE WORDS FIRE MILK BREAD AND WOOD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0021.flac,BUT THE OLD MAN HAD ONLY ONE WHICH WAS FATHER THE GIRL WAS CALLED SISTER OR AGATHA AND THE YOUTH FELIX BROTHER OR SON I CANNOT DESCRIBE THE DELIGHT I FELT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0022.flac,WHEN I LEARNED THE IDEAS APPROPRIATED TO EACH OF THESE SOUNDS AND WAS ABLE TO PRONOUNCE THEM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0023.flac,AS YET TO UNDERSTAND OR APPLY THEM SUCH AS GOOD DEAREST UNHAPPY I SPENT THE WINTER IN THIS MANNER THE GENTLE MANNERS AND BEAUTY OF THE COTTAGERS GREATLY ENDEARED THEM TO ME
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0024.flac,WHEN THEY WERE UNHAPPY I FELT DEPRESSED WHEN THEY REJOICED I SYMPATHIZED IN THEIR JOYS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0025.flac,OFTEN ENDEAVOURED TO ENCOURAGE HIS CHILDREN AS SOMETIMES I FOUND THAT HE CALLED THEM TO CAST OFF THEIR MELANCHOLY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0026.flac,AGATHA LISTENED WITH RESPECT HER EYES SOMETIMES FILLED WITH TEARS WHICH SHE ENDEAVOURED TO WIPE AWAY UNPERCEIVED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0027.flac,AND TONE WERE MORE CHEERFUL AFTER HAVING LISTENED TO THE EXHORTATIONS OF HER FATHER IT WAS NOT THUS WITH FELIX HE WAS ALWAYS THE SADDEST OF THE GROUP AND EVEN TO MY UNPRACTISED SENSES HE APPEARED TO HAVE SUFFERED MORE DEEPLY THAN HIS FRIENDS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0028.flac,BUT IF HIS COUNTENANCE WAS MORE SORROWFUL
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0029.flac,ESPECIALLY WHEN HE ADDRESSED THE OLD MAN I COULD MENTION INNUMERABLE INSTANCES WHICH ALTHOUGH SLIGHT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0030.flac,IN THE MIDST OF POVERTY AND WANT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0031.flac,FROM BENEATH THE SNOWY GROUND EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE SHE HAD RISEN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0032.flac,WHERE TO HIS PERPETUAL ASTONISHMENT HE FOUND HIS STORE ALWAYS REPLENISHED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND IN THE DAY I BELIEVE HE WORKED SOMETIMES FOR A NEIGHBOURING FARMER BECAUSE HE OFTEN WENT FORTH AND DID NOT RETURN UNTIL DINNER YET BROUGHT NO WOOD WITH HIM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0033.flac,HE READ TO THE OLD MAN AND AGATHA THIS READING HAD PUZZLED ME EXTREMELY AT FIRST BUT BY DEGREES I DISCOVERED THAT HE UTTERED MANY OF THE SAME SOUNDS WHEN HE READ AS WHEN HE TALKED I CONJECTURED THEREFORE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0034.flac,THAT HE FOUND ON THE PAPER SIGNS FOR SPEECH WHICH HE UNDERSTOOD AND I ARDENTLY LONGED TO COMPREHEND THESE ALSO BUT HOW WAS THAT POSSIBLE WHEN I DID NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND THE SOUNDS FOR WHICH THEY STOOD AS SIGNS I IMPROVED HOWEVER SENSIBLY IN THIS SCIENCE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0035.flac,OF CONVERSATION ALTHOUGH I APPLIED MY WHOLE MIND TO THE ENDEAVOUR
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0036.flac,TO DISCOVER MYSELF TO THE COTTAGERS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0037.flac,WHICH KNOWLEDGE MIGHT ENABLE ME TO MAKE THEM OVERLOOK THE DEFORMITY OF MY FIGURE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0038.flac,AS THE SUN BECAME WARMER AND THE LIGHT OF DAY LONGER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0039.flac,FROM THIS TIME FELIX WAS MORE EMPLOYED AND THE HEART MOVING INDICATIONS OF IMPENDING FAMINE DISAPPEARED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0040.flac,AND THEY PROCURED A SUFFICIENCY OF IT SEVERAL NEW KINDS OF PLANTS SPRANG UP IN THE GARDEN WHICH THEY DRESSED AND THESE SIGNS OF COMFORT INCREASED DAILY AS THE SEASON ADVANCED THE OLD MAN LEANING ON HIS SON
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0041.flac,MY MODE OF LIFE IN MY HOVEL WAS UNIFORM DURING THE MORNING I ATTENDED THE MOTIONS OF THE COTTAGERS AND WHEN THEY WERE DISPERSED IN VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS I SLEPT THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY WAS SPENT IN OBSERVING MY FRIENDS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0042.flac,WHEN THEY HAD RETIRED TO REST IF THERE WAS ANY MOON OR THE NIGHT WAS STAR LIGHT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0043.flac,AND ONCE OR TWICE I HEARD THEM ON THESE OCCASIONS UTTER THE WORDS GOOD SPIRIT WONDERFUL
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0044.flac,MY THOUGHTS NOW BECAME MORE ACTIVE AND I LONGED TO DISCOVER THE MOTIVES AND FEELINGS OF THESE LOVELY CREATURES I WAS INQUISITIVE TO KNOW WHY FELIX APPEARED SO MISERABLE AND AGATHA SO SAD I THOUGHT FOOLISH WRETCH
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0045.flac,THAT IT MIGHT BE IN MY POWER TO RESTORE HAPPINESS TO THESE DESERVING PEOPLE WHEN I SLEPT OR WAS ABSENT THE FORMS OF THE VENERABLE BLIND FATHER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0046.flac,I IMAGINED THAT THEY WOULD BE DISGUSTED UNTIL
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0047.flac,AND LED ME TO APPLY WITH FRESH ARDOUR TO THE ACQUIRING THE ART OF LANGUAGE MY ORGANS WERE INDEED HARSH BUT SUPPLE AND ALTHOUGH MY VOICE WAS VERY UNLIKE THE SOFT MUSIC OF THEIR TONES YET I PRONOUNCED SUCH WORDS AS I UNDERSTOOD WITH TOLERABLE EASE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0048.flac,GREATLY ALTERED THE ASPECT OF THE EARTH MEN WHO BEFORE THIS CHANGE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN HID IN CAVES DISPERSED THEMSELVES AND WERE EMPLOYED IN VARIOUS ARTS OF CULTIVATION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0049.flac,HAPPY HAPPY EARTH FIT HABITATION FOR GODS WHICH SO SHORT A TIME BEFORE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/359/730-359-0050.flac,MY SPIRITS WERE ELEVATED BY THE ENCHANTING APPEARANCE OF NATURE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0000.flac,I NOW HASTEN TO THE MORE MOVING PART OF MY STORY I SHALL RELATE EVENTS THAT IMPRESSED ME WITH FEELINGS WHICH FROM WHAT I HAD BEEN HAVE MADE ME WHAT I AM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0001.flac,IT SURPRISED ME THAT WHAT BEFORE WAS DESERT AND GLOOMY SHOULD NOW BLOOM WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AND VERDURE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0002.flac,MY SENSES WERE GRATIFIED AND REFRESHED BY A THOUSAND SCENTS OF DELIGHT AND A THOUSAND SIGHTS OF BEAUTY IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE DAYS WHEN MY COTTAGERS PERIODICALLY RESTED FROM LABOUR THE OLD MAN PLAYED ON HIS GUITAR
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0003.flac,THAT I OBSERVED THE COUNTENANCE OF FELIX WAS MELANCHOLY BEYOND EXPRESSION HE SIGHED FREQUENTLY AND ONCE HIS FATHER PAUSED IN HIS MUSIC AND I CONJECTURED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0004.flac,THAT HE INQUIRED THE CAUSE OF HIS SON'S SORROW FELIX REPLIED IN A CHEERFUL ACCENT AND THE OLD MAN WAS RECOMMENCING HIS MUSIC WHEN SOMEONE TAPPED AT THE DOOR IT WAS A LADY ON HORSEBACK ACCOMPANIED BY A COUNTRY MAN AS A GUIDE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0005.flac,THE LADY WAS DRESSED IN A DARK SUIT AND COVERED WITH A THICK BLACK VEIL AGATHA ASKED A QUESTION TO WHICH THE STRANGER ONLY REPLIED BY PRONOUNCING IN A SWEET ACCENT THE NAME OF FELIX
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0006.flac,ON HEARING THIS WORD FELIX CAME UP HASTILY TO THE LADY WHO WHEN SHE SAW HIM THREW UP HER VEIL
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0007.flac,AND HER COMPLEXION WONDROUSLY FAIR
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0008.flac,EVERY TRAIT OF SORROW VANISHED FROM HIS FACE AND IT INSTANTLY EXPRESSED A DEGREE OF ECSTATIC JOY OF WHICH I COULD HARDLY HAVE BELIEVED IT CAPABLE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0009.flac,SHE APPEARED AFFECTED BY DIFFERENT FEELINGS WIPING A FEW TEARS FROM HER LOVELY EYES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0010.flac,SHE DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HIM BUT SMILED HE ASSISTED HER TO DISMOUNT AND DISMISSING HER GUIDE CONDUCTED HER INTO THE COTTAGE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0011.flac,AND WOULD HAVE KISSED HIS HAND BUT HE RAISED HER AND EMBRACED HER AFFECTIONATELY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0012.flac,SHE WAS NEITHER UNDERSTOOD BY NOR HERSELF UNDERSTOOD THE COTTAGERS THEY MADE MANY SIGNS WHICH I DID NOT COMPREHEND BUT I SAW THAT HER PRESENCE DIFFUSED GLADNESS THROUGH THE COTTAGE DISPELLING THEIR SORROW AS THE SUN DISSIPATES THE MORNING MISTS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0013.flac,AND POINTING TO HER BROTHER MADE SIGNS WHICH APPEARED TO ME TO MEAN THAT HE HAD BEEN SORROWFUL UNTIL SHE CAME SOME HOURS PASSED THUS WHILE THEY BY THEIR COUNTENANCES EXPRESSED JOY THE CAUSE OF WHICH I DID NOT COMPREHEND
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0014.flac,PRESENTLY I FOUND BY THE FREQUENT RECURRENCE OF SOME SOUND WHICH THE STRANGER REPEATED AFTER THEM THAT SHE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE AND THE IDEA INSTANTLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SHOULD MAKE USE OF THE SAME INSTRUCTIONS TO THE SAME END
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0015.flac,RETIRED EARLY WHEN THEY SEPARATED FELIX KISSED THE HAND OF THE STRANGER AND SAID GOOD NIGHT SWEET SAFIE HE SAT UP MUCH LONGER CONVERSING WITH HIS FATHER AND BY THE FREQUENT REPETITION OF HER NAME I CONJECTURED THAT THEIR LOVELY GUEST
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0016.flac,WAS THE SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO UNDERSTAND THEM AND BENT EVERY FACULTY TOWARDS THAT PURPOSE BUT FOUND IT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THE NEXT MORNING FELIX WENT OUT TO HIS WORK
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0017.flac,AND AFTER THE USUAL OCCUPATIONS OF AGATHA WERE FINISHED THE ARABIAN SAT AT THE FEET OF THE OLD MAN AND TAKING HIS GUITAR PLAYED SOME AIRS SO ENTRANCINGLY BEAUTIFUL THAT THEY AT ONCE DREW TEARS OF SORROW AND DELIGHT FROM MY EYES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0018.flac,WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE GAVE THE GUITAR TO AGATHA WHO AT FIRST DECLINED IT SHE PLAYED A SIMPLE AIR AND HER VOICE ACCOMPANIED IT IN SWEET ACCENTS BUT UNLIKE THE WONDROUS STRAIN OF THE STRANGER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0019.flac,THE OLD MAN APPEARED ENRAPTURED AND SAID SOME WORDS WHICH AGATHA ENDEAVOURED TO EXPLAIN TO SAFIE AND BY WHICH HE APPEARED TO WISH TO EXPRESS THAT SHE BESTOWED ON HIM THE GREATEST DELIGHT BY HER MUSIC
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0020.flac,THE DAYS NOW PASSED AS PEACEABLY AS BEFORE WITH THE SOLE ALTERATION THAT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0021.flac,IN THE COUNTENANCES OF MY FRIENDS SAFIE WAS ALWAYS GAY AND HAPPY SHE AND I IMPROVED RAPIDLY IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGE SO THAT IN TWO MONTHS I BEGAN TO COMPREHEND MOST OF THE WORDS UTTERED BY MY PROTECTORS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0022.flac,IN THE MEANWHILE ALSO THE BLACK GROUND WAS COVERED WITH HERBAGE AND THE GREEN BANKS INTERSPERSED WITH INNUMERABLE FLOWERS SWEET TO THE SCENT AND THE EYES STARS OF PALE RADIANCE AMONG THE MOONLIGHT WOODS THE SUN BECAME WARMER THE NIGHTS CLEAR AND BALMY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0023.flac,ALTHOUGH THEY WERE CONSIDERABLY SHORTENED BY THE LATE SETTING AND EARLY RISING OF THE SUN FOR I NEVER VENTURED ABROAD DURING DAYLIGHT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0024.flac,MY DAYS WERE SPENT IN CLOSE ATTENTION THAT I MIGHT MORE SPEEDILY MASTER THE LANGUAGE AND I MAY BOAST
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0025.flac,WHO UNDERSTOOD VERY LITTLE AND CONVERSED IN BROKEN ACCENTS WHILST I COMPREHENDED AND COULD IMITATE ALMOST EVERY WORD THAT WAS SPOKEN WHILE I IMPROVED IN SPEECH I ALSO LEARNED THE SCIENCE OF LETTERS AS IT WAS TAUGHT TO THE STRANGER AND THIS OPENED BEFORE ME
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0026.flac,THE BOOK FROM WHICH FELIX INSTRUCTED SAFIE WAS VOLNEY'S RUINS OF EMPIRES I SHOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE PURPORT OF THIS BOOK HAD NOT FELIX IN READING IT

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/730/360/730-360-0028.flac,AND A VIEW OF THE SEVERAL EMPIRES AT PRESENT EXISTING IN THE WORLD IT GAVE ME AN INSIGHT INTO THE MANNERS GOVERNMENTS AND RELIGIONS OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONS OF THE EARTH

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7780/274562/7780-274562-0084.flac,THAT THE TRUE RESULT OF THE NATURAL STYLE OF GARDENING IS SEEN RATHER IN THE ABSENCE OF ALL DEFECTS AND INCONGRUITIES THAN IN THE CREATION OF ANY SPECIAL WONDERS OR MIRACLES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/7780/274562/7780-274562-0085.flac,IS A PROPOSITION BETTER SUITED TO THE GROVELLING APPREHENSION OF THE HERD THAN TO THE FERVID DREAMS OF THE MAN OF GENIUS THE MERIT SUGGESTED IS AT BEST NEGATIVE

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0004.flac,THE OTHER POND PEOPLE LIKED THEM MUCH BETTER THAN THEY DID THEIR NEIGHBORS THE MINKS THE WILD DUCKS WHO NESTED IN THE SEDGES WERE QUITE WILLING THAT THE YOUNG MUSKRATS SHOULD PLAY WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND THE MUD HENS WERE NOT AFRAID OF THEM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0005.flac,MUD HENS CANNOT BEAR MINKS THEY SAY THAT WHEN A MUD CHICKEN IS MISSING FROM THE NEST

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0007.flac,YES GREAT PITY CHUCKLED THE OLD MUSKRAT HOW GLAD YOU WOULD BE TO SEE THEM HE SMILED ALL AROUND HIS LITTLE MOUTH AND SHOWED HIS GNAWING TEETH
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0008.flac,HE KNEW THAT THE FROGS WERE BETTER OFF ASLEEP IN THE MUD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POND THAN THEY WOULD BE SITTING IN THE SUNSHINE WITH A FEW HUNGRY GULLS ABOVE THEM THE TURTLES WERE SLEEPING ALL WINTER TOO
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0009.flac,THE EELS WERE LYING AT THE BOTTOM STUPID AND DROWSY AND SOMEWHERE THE WATER ADDERS WERE HIDDEN AWAY DREAMING OF SPRING OF ALL THE BIRDS WHO LIVED BY THE WATER ONLY THE GULLS WERE THERE AND THEY WERE NOT POPULAR
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0010.flac,IT IS TRUE THAT THEY HELPED KEEP THE POND SWEET AND CLEAN AND PICKED UP AND CARRIED AWAY MANY THINGS WHICH MADE THE SHORE UNTIDY STILL THEY WERE RUDE AND TALKED TOO LOUDLY AND WORE THEIR FEATHERS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY LOOKED LIKE FINE LARGE BIRDS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0011.flac,THE OTHER POND PEOPLE SAID THAT WAS JUST LIKE THEM ALWAYS PRETENDING TO BE MORE THAN THEY REALLY WERE FIFTEEN YOUNG MUSKRATS ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND ALL BORN THE SUMMER BEFORE STARTED OFF TO LOOK AT THE OLD HOME
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0012.flac,WHERE THEY WERE CHILDREN TOGETHER THAT IS TO SAY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0013.flac,AND WHEN THEY WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LOOK OUT FOR THEMSELVES FIVE MORE CAME TO LIVE IN THE OLD NEST AND WHEN THESE WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LEAVE THE NEST ANOTHER FIVE WERE BORN IT DOESN'T MEAN SO MUCH TO MUSKRATS TO BE BROTHERS AND SISTERS AS IT DOES TO SOME PEOPLE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0014.flac,AND TO HEAR THEM SLAP THEIR LONG SCALY TAILS ON THE WATER WHEN THEY DOVE THEY HAD SHORT DOWNY FUR ALMOST BLACK ON THE BACK SOFT GRAY UNDERNEATH AND A REDDISH BROWN EVERYWHERE ELSE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0015.flac,THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FUR ON THEIR TAILS OR ON THEIR FEET AND THOSE PARTS WERE BLACK THESE FIFTEEN CHILDREN HAD BEEN FAIRLY WELL BROUGHT UP BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THEIR MOTHER HAD MANY CARES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0016.flac,SO IT IS NOT STRANGE IF THEY SOMETIMES BEHAVED BADLY IN SOME OTHER FAMILIES WHERE THERE WERE ONLY NINE OR TEN BABIES ALL THE SEASON THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP MORE STRICTLY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0017.flac,LIKE ALL YOUNG MUSKRATS THEY WERE FULL OF FUN AND THERE WERE FEW PLEASANTER SIGHTS THAN TO SEE THEM FROLICKING ON A WARM MOONLIGHT EVENING WHEN THEY LOOKED LIKE BROWN BALLS ROLLING AND BOUNDING AROUND ON THE SHORE OR PLUNGING INTO THE WATER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0018.flac,IF THEY HAD ALL BEEN EXACTLY THE SAME AGE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN PLEASANTER FOR THE OLDEST FIVE WOULD PUT ON AIRS AND CALL THE OTHERS THE CHILDREN AND THE NEXT FIVE WOULD CALL THE YOUNGEST FIVE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0019.flac,BABIES ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL WELL GROWN THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR THE YOUNGEST FIVE TO CALL OTHER MUSKRATS BABIES SO WHEN THEY WERE WARM AND WELL FED AND GOOD NATURED THEY LAUGHED AND SAID WHO CARES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0020.flac,WHEN THEY WERE COLD AND HUNGRY THEY SLAPPED THEIR TAILS ON THE GROUND OR ON THE WATER AND SAID DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE SMART
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0021.flac,SHE WOULD SAY NOW CHILDREN IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY HAD TO STOP
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0022.flac,TEASING IS NOT SO VERY BAD YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH IT IS DREADFULLY SILLY BUT WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN BY TEASING THEY SOMETIMES GET TO SAYING THINGS IN EARNEST EVEN REALLY HATEFUL MEAN THINGS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0023.flac,AND THAT WAS WHAT MADE THE MUSKRAT FATHER AND MOTHER STOP IT WHENEVER THEY COULD NOW THE WHOLE FIFTEEN CROWDED AROUND THE OLD SUMMER HOME AND SOME OF THEM WENT IN ONE WAY AND SOME OF THEM WENT IN ANOTHER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0024.flac,FOR EVERY MUSKRAT'S SUMMER HOUSE HAS SEVERAL BURROWS LEADING TO IT WHEN THEY REACHED THE OLD NEST AT THE END ALL OF THEM TRIED TO GET IN AT ONCE AND THEY PUSHED EACH OTHER AROUND WITH THEIR BROAD LITTLE HEADS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0025.flac,SCRAMBLED AND CLUTCHED AND HELD ON WITH THEIR STRONG LITTLE FEET FIVE OF THEM SAID IT'S OUR TURN FIRST WE'RE THE OLDEST AND FIVE MORE SAID WELL IT'S OUR TURN NEXT ANYWAY CAUSE WE'RE NEXT OLDEST
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0026.flac,THE OTHERS SAID YOU MIGHT GIVE UP TO US BECAUSE WE'RE THE YOUNGEST THEY PUSHED AND SCRAMBLED SOME MORE AND ONE OF THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN SAID TO ONE OF THE OLDEST WELL I DON'T CARE I'M JUST AS BIG AS YOU ARE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0027.flac,WHICH WAS SO AND THE OLDER ONE ANSWERED BACK WELL YOU'RE NOT SO GOOD LOOKING WHICH WAS ALSO TRUE THEN PART OF THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0028.flac,TOOK SIDES WITH ONE AND PART TOOK SIDES WITH THE OTHER WHAT HAD BEEN A LOVELY FROLIC BECAME AN UNPLEASANT DISGRACEFUL QUARREL AND THEY SAID SUCH THINGS AS THESE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0029.flac,YOU SLAPPED YOUR TAIL ON MY BACK
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0030.flac,OR THE HALF WAY BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHOULD GO FIRST INTO THE OLD NEST AND IT DIDN'T MATTER A BIT WHO WAS OLDEST OR WHO WAS YOUNGEST AND IT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THEIR DREADFUL HABIT OF TEASING
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0031.flac,BUT THEY WERE TOO MUCH EXCITED TO MIND AND THEY DID NOT STOP UNTIL THEIR FATHER CAME AND SLAPPED THEM WITH HIS TAIL THEN THEY KEPT STILL AND LISTENED TO THEIR MOTHER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0032.flac,SHE TOLD THEM THAT THEY SHOULD LEAVE THE PLACE AT ONCE AND NOT ONE OF THEM SHOULD EVEN SET FOOT IN THE OLD NEST SUPPOSE SOMEBODY HAD GOTTEN HURT SHE SAID THIS MADE THE YOUNG MUSKRATS LOOK VERY SOBER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0033.flac,FOR THEY KNEW THAT THE MUSKRAT WHO IS HURT IN WINTER NEVER GETS WELL AFTER SHE HAD LET THEM THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE SHE SAID I SHALL PUNISH YOU ALL FOR THIS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0034.flac,THEN THERE WAS NO QUARREL AMONG HER CHILDREN TO SEE WHO SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST TURN NOT AT ALL ONE YOUNG MUSKRAT SAID AREN'T YOU GOING TO LET US PLAY ANY MORE YES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0035.flac,BUT I SHALL CHOOSE THE GAMES THE OLDEST FIVE WILL PLAY MUD TURTLES IN WINTER THE NEXT FIVE WILL PLAY FROGS IN WINTER AND THE YOUNGEST FIVE WILL PLAY SNAKES IN WINTER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0036.flac,THE WAY TO PLAY THESE GAMES IS TO LIE PERFECTLY STILL IN SOME DARK PLACE AND NOT SAY A WORD THE YOUNG MUSKRATS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER SORROWFULLY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0037.flac,THEY THOUGHT IT SOUNDED VERY MUCH THE SAME AS BEING SENT TO BED FOR BEING NAUGHTY THEY DID NOT DARE SAY ANYTHING FOR THEY KNEW THAT ALTHOUGH THEIR MOTHER WAS GENTLE AS MUSKRATS ARE MOST OF THE TIME SHE COULD BE VERY SEVERE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8324/286683/8324-286683-0038.flac,SO THEY WENT AWAY QUIETLY TO PLAY WHAT SHE HAD TOLD THEM THEY MUST BUT IT WAS NOT MUCH FUN TO PLAY THOSE GAMES WHEN ALL THE OTHERS WERE HAVING A FINE TIME IN THE SUNSHINE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/839/130898/839-130898-0000.flac,IN LATITUDE FORTY SEVEN DEGREES

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0035.flac,AND AMONGST THEM BY MISTER TEMPLETON AND HERE I MAY AS WELL SKETCH THE RESULT OF THAT STRANGE INTRODUCTION TO THE DISSENTING MINISTER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0036.flac,THE GIST OF THE LETTER LAY IN THESE WORDS I CONFESS IT PERPLEXES ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO RECONCILE YOUR CHRISTIAN AND FRIENDLY BEHAVIOUR TO ONE WHOM MOST OF YOUR BRETHREN WOULD CONSIDER AS MUCH BENEATH THEIR NOTICE AS INFERIOR TO THEM IN SOCIAL POSITION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0037.flac,WITH YOUR REMAINING THE MINISTER OF A CHURCH IN WHICH SUCH ENORMITIES AS YOU EMPLOYED YOUR PRIVATE INFLUENCE TO COUNTERACT IN MY CASE ARE NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT CERTAINLY LAWFUL AND RECOGNIZED BY MOST OF ITS MEMBERS AS LIKEWISE EXPEDIENT TO THIS I REPLIED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0038.flac,MY DEAR SIR I DO NOT LIKE WRITING LETTERS ESPECIALLY ON SUBJECTS OF IMPORTANCE THERE ARE A THOUSAND CHANCES OF MISUNDERSTANDING WHEREAS IN A PERSONAL INTERVIEW THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF CONTROVERSY BEING HALLOWED BY COMMUNION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0039.flac,TO MISSUS TEMPLETON FOR NOT INVITING HER WITH YOU
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0040.flac,HOW YOU COULD BELONG TO A CHURCH WHICH AUTHORIZES THINGS OF WHICH YOU YOURSELF SO HEARTILY DISAPPROVE AND I ANSWER YOU I RETURNED THAT JUST TO SUCH A CHURCH OUR LORD BELONGED I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU OUR LORD BELONGED TO THE JEWISH CHURCH
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0041.flac,I WANT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU THE PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH HE ACTED WITH REGARD TO CHURCH RATES CERTAINLY I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR INTERRUPTING YOU THE PHARISEES DEMANDED A TRIBUTE WHICH IT IS ALLOWED WAS FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE TEMPLE AND ITS WORSHIP
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0042.flac,OUR LORD DID NOT REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR AUTHORITY NOTWITHSTANDING THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH THEY HAD DEGRADED THE RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES OF THE JEWISH CHURCH HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF A CHILD OF THE CHURCH BUT SAID THAT AS A CHILD HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN LEFT TO CONTRIBUTE AS HE PLEASED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0043.flac,TO THE SUPPORT OF ITS ORDINANCES AND NOT TO BE COMPELLED AFTER SUCH A FASHION THERE I HAVE YOU EXCLAIMED MISTER TEMPLETON
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0044.flac,I GRANT IT IT IS ENTIRELY WRONG A VERY UNCHRISTIAN PROCEEDING BUT OUR LORD DID NOT THEREFORE DESERT THE CHURCH AS YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO HE PAID THE MONEY LEST HE SHOULD OFFEND AND NOT HAVING IT OF HIS OWN HE HAD TO ASK HIS FATHER FOR IT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0045.flac,OR WHAT CAME TO THE SAME THING MAKE A SERVANT OF HIS FATHER NAMELY A FISH IN THE SEA OF GALILEE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0046.flac,IT IS WRONG TO COMPEL AND WRONG TO REFUSE THE PAYMENT OF A CHURCH RATE I DO NOT SAY EQUALLY WRONG IT IS MUCH WORSE TO COMPEL THAN TO REFUSE YOU ARE VERY GENEROUS RETURNED MISTER TEMPLETON
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0047.flac,MAY I HOPE THAT YOU WILL DO ME THE CREDIT TO BELIEVE THAT IF I SAW CLEARLY THAT THEY WERE THE SAME THING I WOULD NOT HESITATE A MOMENT TO FOLLOW OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE I BELIEVE IT PERFECTLY THEREFORE HOWEVER WE MAY DIFFER WE ARE IN REALITY AT NO STRIFE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0048.flac,BUT IS THERE NOT THIS DIFFERENCE THAT OUR LORD WAS AS YOU SAY A CHILD OF THE JEWISH CHURCH WHICH WAS INDUBITABLY ESTABLISHED BY GOD NOW IF I CANNOT CONSCIENTIOUSLY BELONG TO THE SO CALLED ENGLISH CHURCH WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY CHURCH RATE OR TRIBUTE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0049.flac,SHALL I TELL YOU THE ARGUMENT THE ENGLISH CHURCH MIGHT THEN USE THE CHURCH MIGHT SAY THEN YOU ARE A STRANGER AND NO CHILD THEREFORE LIKE THE KINGS OF THE EARTH WE MAY TAKE TRIBUTE OF YOU SO YOU SEE IT WOULD COME TO THIS THAT DISSENTERS ALONE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PAY CHURCH RATES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0050.flac,WE BOTH LAUGHED AT THIS PUSHING OF THE ARGUMENT TO ILLEGITIMATE CONCLUSIONS THEN I RESUMED BUT THE REAL ARGUMENT IS THAT NOT FOR SUCH FAULTS SHOULD WE SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER NOT FOR SUCH FAULTS OR ANY FAULTS SO LONG AS IT IS THE REPOSITORY OF THE TRUTH SHOULD YOU SEPARATE FROM THE CHURCH
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0051.flac,I WILL YIELD THE POINT WHEN YOU CAN SHOW ME THE SAME GROUND FOR BELIEVING THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND THE NATIONAL CHURCH APPOINTED SUCH BY GOD THAT I CAN SHOW YOU AND YOU KNOW ALREADY FOR RECEIVING THE JEWISH CHURCH AS THE APPOINTMENT OF GOD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0052.flac,THAT WOULD INVOLVE A LONG ARGUMENT UPON WHICH THOUGH I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT UPON THE MATTER MYSELF I CANNOT SAY I AM PREPARED TO ENTER AT THIS MOMENT MEANTIME I WOULD JUST ASK YOU WHETHER YOU ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY A CHILD OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0053.flac,HAVING RECEIVED FROM IT A THOUSAND INFLUENCES FOR GOOD IF IN NO OTHER WAY YET THROUGH YOUR FATHERS TO FIND IT NO GREAT HARDSHIP AND NOT VERY UNREASONABLE TO PAY A TRIFLE TO KEEP IN REPAIR ONE OF THE TABERNACLES IN WHICH OUR FOREFATHERS WORSHIPPED TOGETHER IF
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0054.flac,AS I HOPE YOU WILL ALLOW IN SOME IMPERFECT MEASURE GOD IS WORSHIPPED AND THE TRUTH IS PREACHED IN IT MOST WILLINGLY WOULD I PAY THE MONEY I OBJECT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE RATE IS COMPULSORY AND THEREIN YOU HAVE OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE TO THE CONTRARY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0055.flac,A SILENCE FOLLOWED FOR I HAD TO DEAL WITH AN HONEST MAN WHO WAS THINKING I RESUMED A THOUSAND DIFFICULTIES WILL NO DOUBT COME UP TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE MATTER DO NOT SUPPOSE I AM ANXIOUS TO CONVINCE YOU I BELIEVE THAT OUR FATHER OUR ELDER BROTHER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0056.flac,AND THE SPIRIT THAT PROCEEDETH FROM THEM IS TEACHING YOU AS I BELIEVE I TOO AM BEING TAUGHT BY THE SAME WHY THEN SHOULD I BE ANXIOUS TO CONVINCE YOU OF ANYTHING WILL YOU NOT IN HIS GOOD TIME COME TO SEE WHAT HE WOULD HAVE YOU SEE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0057.flac,I AM RELIEVED TO SPEAK MY MIND KNOWING HE WOULD HAVE US SPEAK OUR MINDS TO EACH OTHER BUT I DO NOT WANT TO PROSELYTIZE IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND YOU WILL PROBABLY DO SO ON DIFFERENT GROUNDS FROM ANY I GIVE YOU
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0058.flac,AND I HAVEN'T BEEN TO A UNIVERSITY LIKE YOU BUT I'M NO FOOL EITHER I HOPE DON'T BE OFFENDED AT MY QUESTION WOULDN'T YOU BE GLAD TO SEE ME OUT OF YOUR PARISH NOW I BEGAN TO SPEAK BUT HE WENT ON
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0059.flac,DON'T YOU REGARD ME AS AN INTERLOPER NOW ONE WHO HAS NO RIGHT TO SPEAK BECAUSE HE DOES NOT BELONG TO THE CHURCH GOD FORBID I ANSWERED IF A WORD OF MINE WOULD MAKE YOU LEAVE MY PARISH TO MORROW I DARE NOT SAY IT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0060.flac,I DO NOT WANT TO INCUR THE REBUKE OF OUR LORD FOR SURELY THE WORDS FORBID HIM NOT INVOLVED SOME REBUKE WOULD IT NOT BE A FEARFUL THING THAT ONE SOUL BECAUSE OF A DEED OF MINE SHOULD RECEIVE A LESS PORTION OF ELEVATION OR COMFORT IN HIS JOURNEY TOWARDS HIS HOME
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0061.flac,ARE THERE NOT COUNTLESS MODES OF SAYING THE TRUTH YOU HAVE SOME OF THEM I HOPE I HAVE SOME
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0062.flac,WHO WILL NOT HEAR ME PREACH TO THEM IN THE NAME AND LOVE OF GOD MISTER TEMPLETON SPEAK THAT YOU DO KNOW AND TESTIFY THAT YOU HAVE SEEN YOU AND I WILL HELP EACH OTHER IN PROPORTION AS WE SERVE THE MASTER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0063.flac,I ONLY SAY THAT IN SEPARATING FROM US YOU ARE IN EFFECT AND BY YOUR CONDUCT SAYING TO US DO NOT PREACH FOR YOU FOLLOW NOT WITH US I WILL NOT BE GUILTY OF THE SAME TOWARDS YOU YOUR FATHERS DID THE CHURCH NO END OF GOOD BY LEAVING IT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0064.flac,BUT IT IS TIME TO UNITE NOW ONCE MORE FOLLOWED A SILENCE IF PEOPLE COULD ONLY MEET AND LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE FACE SAID MISTER TEMPLETON AT LENGTH THEY MIGHT FIND THERE WAS NOT SUCH A GULF BETWEEN THEM AS THEY HAD FANCIED AND SO WE PARTED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0065.flac,NOW I DO NOT WRITE ALL THIS FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHURCH RATE QUESTION I WRITE IT TO COMMEMORATE THE SPIRIT IN WHICH MISTER TEMPLETON MET ME FOR IT IS OF CONSEQUENCE THAT TWO MEN WHO LOVE THEIR MASTER SHOULD RECOGNIZE EACH THAT THE OTHER DOES SO AND THEREUPON IF NOT BEFORE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0066.flac,AND MANY A TIME ERE HIS DEATH WE CONSULTED TOGETHER ABOUT THINGS THAT BEFELL ONCE HE CAME TO ME ABOUT A LEGAL DIFFICULTY IN CONNEXION WITH THE DEED OF TRUST OF HIS CHAPEL AND ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT HELP HIM MYSELF I DIRECTED HIM TO SUCH HELP AS WAS THOROUGH
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0067.flac,AND COST HIM NOTHING I NEED NOT SAY HE NEVER BECAME A CHURCHMAN OR THAT I NEVER EXPECTED HE WOULD ALL HIS MEMORIES OF A RELIGIOUS CHILDHOOD ALL THE SOURCES OF THE INFLUENCES WHICH HAD REFINED AND ELEVATED HIM WERE SURROUNDED WITH OTHER ASSOCIATIONS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0068.flac,THAN THOSE OF THE CHURCH AND HER FORMS THE CHURCH WAS HIS GRANDMOTHER NOT HIS MOTHER AND HE HAD NOT MADE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER TILL COMPARATIVELY LATE IN LIFE BUT WHILE I DO NOT SAY THAT HIS INTELLECTUAL OBJECTIONS TO THE CHURCH WERE LESS STRONG THAN THEY HAD BEEN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0069.flac,I AM SURE THAT HIS FEELINGS WERE MODERATED EVEN CHANGED TOWARDS HER AND THOUGH THIS MAY SEEM OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO ONE WHO LOVES THE CHURCH MORE THAN THE BROTHERHOOD IT DOES NOT SEEM OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE TO ME WHO LOVE THE CHURCH BECAUSE OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF WHICH IT IS THE TYPE AND THE RESTORER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8609/283227/8609-283227-0070.flac,IT WAS LONG BEFORE ANOTHER CHURCH RATE WAS LEVIED IN MARSHMALLOWS AND WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCE DID TAKE PLACE NO ONE DREAMED OF CALLING ON MISTER TEMPLETON FOR HIS SHARE IN IT BUT HAVING HEARD OF IT HE CALLED HIMSELF UPON THE CHURCHWARDEN MISTER BROWNRIGG STILL AND OFFERED THE MONEY CHEERFULLY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0000.flac,ALL THE WITNESSES WHO HAD ANYTHING TO SAY HAD LONG AGO GIVEN IN THEIR TESTIMONY AND WHEN AT OR NEAR NOON
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0001.flac,IT WAS TO FIND IN TWO FACES ONLY ANY SIGNS OF THE EAGERNESS AND EXPECTANCY WHICH FILLED HIS OWN BREAST TO SUFFOCATION BUT AS THESE FACES WERE THOSE OF AGNES HALLIDAY AND AMABEL PAGE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0002.flac,HE SOON RECOGNISED THAT HIS OWN JUDGMENT WAS NOT AT FAULT AND THAT NOTWITHSTANDING OUTWARD APPEARANCES AND THE LANGUID INTEREST SHOWN IN THE NOW LAGGING PROCEEDINGS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0003.flac,BUT VITAL CONSEQUENCE FREDERICK WAS NOT VISIBLE IN THE GREAT HALL BUT THAT HE WAS NEAR AT HAND SOON BECAME EVIDENT FROM THE CHANGE SWEETWATER NOW SAW IN AMABEL
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0004.flac,FOR WHILE SHE HAD HITHERTO SAT UNDER THE UNIVERSAL GAZE WITH ONLY THE FAINT SMILE OF CONSCIOUS BEAUTY ON HER INSCRUTABLE FEATURES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0005.flac,AND GLANCED AT THE GREAT DOOR OF ENTRANCE WITH AN EVIL EXPECTANCY THAT STARTLED EVEN SWEETWATER SO LITTLE HAD HE REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THE PASSIONS LABOURING IN THAT VENOMOUS BREAST
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0006.flac,SMILED AS SHE MET HIS EYE WITH THAT CURIOUS SLOW DIPPING OF HER DIMPLES WHICH HAD MORE THAN ONCE CONFOUNDED THE CORONER AND RENDERED HER AT ONCE THE ADMIRATION AND ABHORRENCE OF THE CROWD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0007.flac,LOOKED AWAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0008.flac,FROM WHICH HE HAD REMOVED THE RING WHICH UP TO THIS HOUR HE HAD INVARIABLY WORN ON HIS THIRD FINGER IN THIS GLANCE OF HERS AND THIS ACTION OF HIS BEGAN THE STRUGGLE THAT WAS TO MAKE THAT DAY MEMORABLE IN MANY HEARTS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0009.flac,AND TO HIM A FULL ATTENTION WAS BEING GIVEN IN THE HOPE THAT SOME REAL ENLIGHTENMENT WOULD COME AT LAST TO SETTLE THE QUESTIONS WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED BY AMABEL'S INCOMPLETE AND UNSATISFACTORY TESTIMONY BUT NO MAN CAN FURNISH WHAT HE DOES NOT POSSESS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0010.flac,AND THE FEW FINAL MINUTES BEFORE NOON PASSED BY WITHOUT ANY ADDITION BEING MADE TO THE FACTS WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN PRESENTED FOR GENERAL CONSIDERATION AS THE WITNESS SAT DOWN THE CLOCK BEGAN TO STRIKE AS THE SLOW
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0011.flac,HESITATING STROKES RANG OUT SWEETWATER SAW FREDERICK YIELD TO A SUDDEN BUT MOST PROFOUND EMOTION THE OLD FEAR WHICH WE UNDERSTAND IF SWEETWATER DID NOT HAD AGAIN SEIZED THE VICTIM OF AMABEL'S AMBITION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0012.flac,WITH A FELL AND STEADY PURPOSE HE FOUND HIS RIGHT HAND STEALING TOWARD THE LEFT IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION SHE EXPECTED BETTER TO YIELD THAN FALL HEADLONG INTO THE PIT ONE WORD OF HERS WOULD OPEN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0013.flac,HE HAD NOT MEANT TO YIELD BUT NOW THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME NOW THAT HE MUST AT ONCE AND FOREVER CHOOSE BETWEEN A COURSE THAT LED SIMPLY TO PERSONAL UNHAPPINESS AND ONE THAT INVOLVED NOT ONLY HIMSELF
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0014.flac,BUT THOSE DEAREST TO HIM IN DISGRACE AND SORROW HE FELT HIMSELF WEAKEN TO THE POINT OF CLUTCHING AT WHATEVER WOULD SAVE HIM FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONFESSION MORAL STRENGTH AND THAT TENACITY OF PURPOSE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0015.flac,WHICH ONLY COMES FROM YEARS OF SELF CONTROL WERE TOO LATELY AWAKENED IN HIS BREAST TO SUSTAIN HIM NOW AS STROKE AFTER STROKE FELL ON THE EAR HE FELT HIMSELF YIELDING BEYOND RECOVERY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0016.flac,AND HAD ALMOST TOUCHED HIS FINGER IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION OF ASSENT WHICH AMABEL AWAITED WITH BREATHLESS EXPECTATION WHEN WAS IT MIRACLE OR ONLY THE SUGGESTION OF HIS BETTER NATURE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0017.flac,THE MEMORY OF A FACE FULL OF HOLY PLEADING ROSE FROM THE PAST BEFORE HIS EYES AND WITH AN INNER CRY OF MOTHER HE FLUNG HIS HAND OUT AND CLUTCHED HIS FATHER'S ARM IN A WAY TO BREAK THE CHARM OF HIS OWN DREAD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0018.flac,AND END FOREVER THE EFFECTS OF THE INTOLERABLE FASCINATION THAT WAS WORKING UPON HIM NEXT MINUTE THE LAST STROKE OF NOON RANG OUT AND THE HOUR WAS UP WHICH AMABEL HAD SET AS THE LIMIT OF HER SILENCE A PAUSE

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261139/8629-261139-0020.flac,WHEN FREDERICK LEAPING WITH A BOUND TO HIS FEET DREW ALL EYES TOWARDS HIMSELF WITH THE CRY LET ME BE PUT ON MY OATH I HAVE TESTIMONY TO GIVE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN THIS CASE THE CORONER WAS ASTOUNDED

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261140/8629-261140-0015.flac,AND PRAYED ME TO SEE THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN BEFORE I SLEPT SINCE NOTHING BUT DEATH OR DIRE DISTRESS WOULD HAVE KEPT THEM FROM GRATIFYING THE ONE WHIM OF MY FATHER'S FAILING MIND I PROMISED

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261140/8629-261140-0020.flac,BUT WAS TOO TERRIFIED TO MOVE OR SPEAK AND THIS SATISFIED MY MOTHER AND MADE HER LAST BREATH ONE OF TRUST AND CONTENTED LOVE SHE DIED AS I DREW THE DAGGER FROM HER BREAST
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261140/8629-261140-0021.flac,AND FLUNG IT WILDLY FROM THE WINDOW THEN I LIFTED HER AND LAID HER WHERE YOU FOUND HER ON THE SOFA

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261140/8629-261140-0025.flac,AND OF HOW ONE OF THEM JAMES BY NAME CAME TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS AFFAIR WHEN I LEFT MY DEAD MOTHER'S SIDE I WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF MIND THAT I PASSED WITH SCARCELY SO MUCH AS A GLANCE THE ROOM WHERE MY NEW FOUND FATHER SAT SLEEPING
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261140/8629-261140-0026.flac,BUT AS I HASTENED ON TOWARD THE QUARTER WHERE THE ZABELS LIVED I WAS SEIZED BY SUCH COMPUNCTION FOR HIS DESOLATE STATE THAT I FALTERED IN MY RAPID FLIGHT AND DID NOT ARRIVE AT THE PLACE OF MY DESTINATION AS QUICKLY AS I INTENDED WHEN I DID
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261140/8629-261140-0027.flac,BUT I DID NOT TURN AWAY REMEMBERING MY MOTHER'S ANXIETY AN ANXIETY SO EXTREME IT DISTURBED HER FINAL MOMENTS I APPROACHED THE FRONT DOOR AND WAS ABOUT TO KNOCK WHEN I FOUND IT OPEN GREATLY ASTONISHED I AT ONCE PASSED IN

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261140/8629-261140-0031.flac,I HASTENED AWAY AND TOOK THE SHORTEST PATH HOME HAD I BEEN MORE OF A MAN OR IF MY VISIT TO MISSUS WEBB HAD BEEN ACTUATED BY A MORE COMMUNICABLE MOTIVE I WOULD HAVE GONE AT ONCE TO THE GOOD MAN WHO BELIEVED ME TO BE OF HIS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8629/261140/8629-261140-0032.flac,AND TOLD HIM OF THE STRANGE AND HEART RENDING ADVENTURE WHICH HAD CHANGED THE WHOLE TENOR OF MY THOUGHTS AND LIFE

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/887/123291/887-123291-0037.flac,HOW THOSE STRATA ON WHICH HE LAY SLIPPED DOWN INTO THIS ENORMOUS HOLLOW IN THE GLOBE I CONFESS I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/887/123291/887-123291-0038.flac,CONSIDERABLE COMMOTIONS WERE STILL DISTURBING THE CRUST OF THE EARTH THE LONG CONTINUED COOLING OF THE GLOBE PRODUCED CHASMS FISSURES CLEFTS AND FAULTS INTO WHICH VERY PROBABLY PORTIONS OF THE UPPER EARTH MAY HAVE FALLEN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/887/123291/887-123291-0039.flac,BUT THERE IS THE MAN SURROUNDED BY HIS OWN WORKS BY HATCHETS BY FLINT ARROW HEADS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/887/123291/887-123291-0040.flac,THIS FOSSIL BODY WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THIS IMMENSE CATACOMB WE CAME UPON OTHER BODIES AT EVERY STEP AMONGST THIS MORTAL DUST AND MY UNCLE MIGHT SELECT THE MOST CURIOUS OF THESE SPECIMENS TO DEMOLISH THE INCREDULITY OF SCEPTICS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/887/123291/887-123291-0041.flac,IN FACT IT WAS A WONDERFUL SPECTACLE THAT OF THESE GENERATIONS OF MEN AND ANIMALS COMMINGLED IN A COMMON CEMETERY THEN ONE VERY SERIOUS QUESTION AROSE PRESENTLY WHICH WE SCARCELY DARED TO SUGGEST
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/887/123291/887-123291-0042.flac,HAD ALL THOSE CREATURES SLIDED THROUGH A GREAT FISSURE IN THE CRUST OF THE EARTH DOWN TO THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA WHEN THEY WERE DEAD AND TURNING TO DUST OR HAD THEY LIVED AND GROWN AND DIED HERE IN THIS SUBTERRANEAN WORLD UNDER A FALSE SKY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0000.flac,CHAPTER TWENTY ONE A MOMENT'S GLANCE WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY CATHERINE THAT HER APARTMENT WAS VERY UNLIKE THE ONE WHICH HENRY HAD ENDEAVOURED TO ALARM HER BY THE DESCRIPTION OF IT WAS BY NO MEANS UNREASONABLY LARGE AND CONTAINED NEITHER TAPESTRY NOR VELVET
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0001.flac,THE WALLS WERE PAPERED THE FLOOR WAS CARPETED THE WINDOWS WERE NEITHER LESS PERFECT NOR MORE DIM THAN THOSE OF THE DRAWING ROOM BELOW THE FURNITURE THOUGH NOT OF THE LATEST FASHION WAS HANDSOME AND COMFORTABLE AND THE AIR OF THE ROOM ALTOGETHER FAR FROM UNCHEERFUL
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0002.flac,HER HEART INSTANTANEOUSLY AT EASE ON THIS POINT SHE RESOLVED TO LOSE NO TIME IN PARTICULAR EXAMINATION OF ANYTHING AS SHE GREATLY DREADED DISOBLIGING THE GENERAL BY ANY DELAY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0003.flac,AND SHE WAS PREPARING TO UNPIN THE LINEN PACKAGE WHICH THE CHAISE SEAT HAD CONVEYED FOR HER IMMEDIATE ACCOMMODATION WHEN HER EYE SUDDENLY FELL ON A LARGE HIGH CHEST STANDING BACK IN A DEEP RECESS ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE THE SIGHT OF IT MADE HER START
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0004.flac,AND FORGETTING EVERYTHING ELSE SHE STOOD GAZING ON IT IN MOTIONLESS WONDER WHILE THESE THOUGHTS CROSSED HER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0005.flac,PUSHED BACK TOO AS IF MEANT TO BE OUT OF SIGHT I WILL LOOK INTO IT COST ME WHAT IT MAY I WILL LOOK INTO IT AND DIRECTLY TOO BY DAYLIGHT IF I STAY TILL EVENING MY CANDLE MAY GO OUT SHE ADVANCED AND EXAMINED IT CLOSELY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0006.flac,IT WAS OF CEDAR CURIOUSLY INLAID WITH SOME DARKER WOOD AND RAISED ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE GROUND ON A CARVED STAND OF THE SAME THE LOCK WAS SILVER THOUGH TARNISHED FROM AGE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0007.flac,BROKEN PERHAPS PREMATURELY BY SOME STRANGE VIOLENCE AND ON THE CENTRE OF THE LID WAS A MYSTERIOUS CIPHER IN THE SAME METAL CATHERINE BENT OVER IT INTENTLY BUT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING WITH CERTAINTY SHE COULD NOT IN WHATEVER DIRECTION SHE TOOK IT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0008.flac,BELIEVE THE LAST LETTER TO BE A T AND YET THAT IT SHOULD BE ANYTHING ELSE IN THAT HOUSE WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO RAISE NO COMMON DEGREE OF ASTONISHMENT IF NOT ORIGINALLY THEIRS BY WHAT STRANGE EVENTS COULD IT HAVE FALLEN INTO THE TILNEY FAMILY HER FEARFUL CURIOSITY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0009.flac,WAS EVERY MOMENT GROWING GREATER AND SEIZING WITH TREMBLING HANDS THE HASP OF THE LOCK SHE RESOLVED AT ALL HAZARDS TO SATISFY HERSELF AT LEAST AS TO ITS CONTENTS WITH DIFFICULTY FOR SOMETHING SEEMED TO RESIST HER EFFORTS SHE RAISED THE LID A FEW INCHES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0010.flac,BUT AT THAT MOMENT A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM MADE HER STARTING QUIT HER HOLD AND THE LID CLOSED WITH ALARMING VIOLENCE THIS ILL TIMED INTRUDER WAS MISS TILNEY'S MAID SENT BY HER MISTRESS TO BE OF USE TO MISS MORLAND AND THOUGH CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED HER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0011.flac,AND FORCED HER IN SPITE OF HER ANXIOUS DESIRE TO PENETRATE THIS MYSTERY TO PROCEED IN HER DRESSING WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY HER PROGRESS WAS NOT QUICK FOR HER THOUGHTS AND HER EYES WERE STILL BENT ON THE OBJECT SO WELL CALCULATED TO INTEREST AND ALARM AND THOUGH SHE DARED NOT WASTE A MOMENT UPON A SECOND ATTEMPT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0012.flac,SHE COULD NOT REMAIN MANY PACES FROM THE CHEST AT LENGTH HOWEVER HAVING SLIPPED ONE ARM INTO HER GOWN HER TOILETTE SEEMED SO NEARLY FINISHED THAT THE IMPATIENCE OF HER CURIOSITY MIGHT SAFELY BE INDULGED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0013.flac,AND SO DESPERATE SHOULD BE THE EXERTION OF HER STRENGTH THAT UNLESS SECURED BY SUPERNATURAL MEANS THE LID IN ONE MOMENT SHOULD BE THROWN BACK WITH THIS SPIRIT SHE SPRANG FORWARD AND HER CONFIDENCE DID NOT DECEIVE HER HER RESOLUTE EFFORT THREW BACK THE LID AND GAVE TO HER ASTONISHED EYES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0014.flac,ENTERED THE ROOM AND TO THE RISING SHAME OF HAVING HARBOURED FOR SOME MINUTES AN ABSURD EXPECTATION WAS THEN ADDED THE SHAME OF BEING CAUGHT IN SO IDLE A SEARCH
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0015.flac,SAID MISS TILNEY AS CATHERINE HASTILY CLOSED IT AND TURNED AWAY TO THE GLASS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0016.flac,CATHERINE HAD NO LEISURE FOR SPEECH BEING AT ONCE BLUSHING TYING HER GOWN AND FORMING WISE RESOLUTIONS WITH THE MOST VIOLENT DISPATCH MISS TILNEY GENTLY HINTED HER FEAR OF BEING LATE AND IN HALF A MINUTE THEY RAN DOWNSTAIRS TOGETHER IN AN ALARM NOT WHOLLY UNFOUNDED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0017.flac,FOR GENERAL TILNEY WAS PACING THE DRAWING ROOM HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND AND HAVING ON THE VERY INSTANT OF THEIR ENTERING PULLED THE BELL WITH VIOLENCE ORDERED DINNER TO BE ON TABLE DIRECTLY CATHERINE TREMBLED AT THE EMPHASIS WITH WHICH HE SPOKE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0018.flac,AND SAT PALE AND BREATHLESS IN A MOST HUMBLE MOOD CONCERNED FOR HIS CHILDREN AND DETESTING OLD CHESTS AND THE GENERAL RECOVERING HIS POLITENESS AS HE LOOKED AT HER SPENT THE REST OF HIS TIME IN SCOLDING HIS DAUGHTER FOR SO FOOLISHLY HURRYING HER FAIR FRIEND
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0019.flac,WHO WAS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF BREATH FROM HASTE WHEN THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST OCCASION FOR HURRY IN THE WORLD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0020.flac,TILL THEY WERE HAPPILY SEATED AT THE DINNER TABLE WHEN THE GENERAL'S COMPLACENT SMILES AND A GOOD APPETITE OF HER OWN RESTORED HER TO PEACE THE DINING PARLOUR WAS A NOBLE ROOM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0021.flac,AND FITTED UP IN A STYLE OF LUXURY AND EXPENSE WHICH WAS ALMOST LOST ON THE UNPRACTISED EYE OF CATHERINE WHO SAW LITTLE MORE THAN ITS SPACIOUSNESS AND THE NUMBER OF THEIR ATTENDANTS OF THE FORMER SHE SPOKE ALOUD HER ADMIRATION AND THE GENERAL WITH A VERY GRACIOUS COUNTENANCE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0022.flac,ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN ILL SIZED ROOM AND FURTHER CONFESSED THAT THOUGH AS CARELESS ON SUCH SUBJECTS AS MOST PEOPLE HE DID LOOK UPON A TOLERABLY LARGE EATING ROOM AS ONE OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE HE SUPPOSED HOWEVER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0023.flac,THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN USED TO MUCH BETTER SIZED APARTMENTS AT MISTER ALLEN'S NO INDEED WAS CATHERINE'S HONEST ASSURANCE MISTER ALLEN'S DINING PARLOUR WAS NOT MORE THAN HALF AS LARGE AND SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO LARGE A ROOM AS THIS IN HER LIFE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0024.flac,THE GENERAL'S GOOD HUMOUR INCREASED WHY AS HE HAD SUCH ROOMS HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SIMPLE NOT TO MAKE USE OF THEM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0025.flac,MISTER ALLEN'S HOUSE HE WAS SURE MUST BE EXACTLY OF THE TRUE SIZE FOR RATIONAL HAPPINESS THE EVENING PASSED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DISTURBANCE AND IN THE OCCASIONAL ABSENCE OF GENERAL TILNEY WITH MUCH POSITIVE CHEERFULNESS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0026.flac,IT WAS ONLY IN HIS PRESENCE THAT CATHERINE FELT THE SMALLEST FATIGUE FROM HER JOURNEY AND EVEN THEN EVEN IN MOMENTS OF LANGUOR OR RESTRAINT A SENSE OF GENERAL HAPPINESS PREPONDERATED AND SHE COULD THINK OF HER FRIENDS IN BATH WITHOUT ONE WISH OF BEING WITH THEM THE NIGHT WAS STORMY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0027.flac,THE WIND HAD BEEN RISING AT INTERVALS THE WHOLE AFTERNOON AND BY THE TIME THE PARTY BROKE UP IT BLEW AND RAINED VIOLENTLY CATHERINE AS SHE CROSSED THE HALL LISTENED TO THE TEMPEST WITH SENSATIONS OF AWE AND WHEN SHE HEARD IT RAGE ROUND A CORNER OF THE ANCIENT BUILDING AND CLOSE WITH SUDDEN FURY A DISTANT DOOR
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0028.flac,YES THESE WERE CHARACTERISTIC SOUNDS THEY BROUGHT TO HER RECOLLECTION A COUNTLESS VARIETY OF DREADFUL SITUATIONS AND HORRID SCENES WHICH SUCH BUILDINGS HAD WITNESSED AND SUCH STORMS USHERED IN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0029.flac,AND MOST HEARTILY DID SHE REJOICE IN THE HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HER ENTRANCE WITHIN WALLS SO SOLEMN SHE HAD NOTHING TO DREAD FROM MIDNIGHT ASSASSINS OR DRUNKEN GALLANTS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0030.flac,HENRY HAD CERTAINLY BEEN ONLY IN JEST IN WHAT HE HAD TOLD HER THAT MORNING IN A HOUSE SO FURNISHED AND SO GUARDED SHE COULD HAVE NOTHING TO EXPLORE OR TO SUFFER AND MIGHT GO TO HER BEDROOM AS SECURELY AS IF IT HAD BEEN HER OWN CHAMBER AT FULLERTON
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0031.flac,SHE WAS ENABLED ESPECIALLY ON PERCEIVING THAT MISS TILNEY SLEPT ONLY TWO DOORS FROM HER TO ENTER HER ROOM WITH A TOLERABLY STOUT HEART AND HER SPIRITS WERE IMMEDIATELY ASSISTED BY THE CHEERFUL BLAZE OF A WOOD FIRE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0032.flac,AS SO MANY POOR GIRLS HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO DO AND THEN TO HAVE A FAITHFUL OLD SERVANT FRIGHTENING ONE BY COMING IN WITH A FAGGOT HOW GLAD I AM THAT NORTHANGER IS WHAT IT IS IF IT HAD BEEN LIKE SOME OTHER PLACES I DO NOT KNOW THAT IN SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0033.flac,I COULD HAVE ANSWERED FOR MY COURAGE BUT NOW TO BE SURE THERE IS NOTHING TO ALARM ONE SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM THE WINDOW CURTAINS SEEMED IN MOTION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0034.flac,A GLANCE AT THE OLD CHEST AS SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THIS EXAMINATION WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS USE SHE SCORNED THE CAUSELESS FEARS OF AN IDLE FANCY AND BEGAN WITH A MOST HAPPY INDIFFERENCE TO PREPARE HERSELF FOR BED SHE SHOULD TAKE HER TIME SHE SHOULD NOT HURRY HERSELF
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0035.flac,AS IF SHE WISHED FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIGHT AFTER SHE WERE IN BED THE FIRE THEREFORE DIED AWAY AND CATHERINE HAVING SPENT THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR IN HER ARRANGEMENTS WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF STEPPING INTO BED WHEN ON GIVING A PARTING GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0036.flac,SHE WAS STRUCK BY THE APPEARANCE OF A HIGH OLD FASHIONED BLACK CABINET WHICH THOUGH IN A SITUATION CONSPICUOUS ENOUGH HAD NEVER CAUGHT HER NOTICE BEFORE HENRY'S WORDS HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE EBONY CABINET WHICH WAS TO ESCAPE HER OBSERVATION AT FIRST
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0037.flac,IMMEDIATELY RUSHED ACROSS HER AND THOUGH THERE COULD BE NOTHING REALLY IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING WHIMSICAL IT WAS CERTAINLY A VERY REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE SHE TOOK HER CANDLE AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE CABINET IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY EBONY AND GOLD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0038.flac,BUT IT WAS JAPAN BLACK AND YELLOW JAPAN OF THE HANDSOMEST KIND AND AS SHE HELD HER CANDLE THE YELLOW HAD VERY MUCH THE EFFECT OF GOLD THE KEY WAS IN THE DOOR AND SHE HAD A STRANGE FANCY TO LOOK INTO IT NOT HOWEVER WITH THE SMALLEST EXPECTATION OF FINDING ANYTHING
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0039.flac,BUT IT WAS SO VERY ODD AFTER WHAT HENRY HAD SAID IN SHORT SHE COULD NOT SLEEP TILL SHE HAD EXAMINED IT SO PLACING THE CANDLE WITH GREAT CAUTION ON A CHAIR SHE SEIZED THE KEY WITH A VERY TREMULOUS HAND AND TRIED TO TURN IT BUT IT RESISTED HER UTMOST STRENGTH
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0040.flac,ALARMED BUT NOT DISCOURAGED SHE TRIED IT ANOTHER WAY A BOLT FLEW AND SHE BELIEVED HERSELF SUCCESSFUL BUT HOW STRANGELY MYSTERIOUS THE DOOR WAS STILL IMMOVABLE SHE PAUSED A MOMENT IN BREATHLESS WONDER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0041.flac,THE WIND ROARED DOWN THE CHIMNEY THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE WINDOWS AND EVERYTHING SEEMED TO SPEAK THE AWFULNESS OF HER SITUATION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0042.flac,TO RETIRE TO BED HOWEVER UNSATISFIED ON SUCH A POINT WOULD BE VAIN SINCE SLEEP MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CABINET SO MYSTERIOUSLY CLOSED IN HER IMMEDIATE VICINITY AGAIN THEREFORE SHE APPLIED HERSELF TO THE KEY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0043.flac,AND AFTER MOVING IT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY FOR SOME INSTANTS WITH THE DETERMINED CELERITY OF HOPE'S LAST EFFORT THE DOOR SUDDENLY YIELDED TO HER HAND HER HEART LEAPED WITH EXULTATION AT SUCH A VICTORY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0044.flac,AND HAVING THROWN OPEN EACH FOLDING DOOR THE SECOND BEING SECURED ONLY BY BOLTS OF LESS WONDERFUL CONSTRUCTION THAN THE LOCK THOUGH IN THAT HER EYE COULD NOT DISCERN ANYTHING UNUSUAL A DOUBLE RANGE OF SMALL DRAWERS APPEARED IN VIEW WITH SOME LARGER DRAWERS ABOVE AND BELOW THEM AND IN THE CENTRE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0045.flac,A SMALL DOOR CLOSED ALSO WITH A LOCK AND KEY SECURED IN ALL PROBABILITY A CAVITY OF IMPORTANCE CATHERINE'S HEART BEAT QUICK BUT HER COURAGE DID NOT FAIL HER WITH A CHEEK FLUSHED BY HOPE AND AN EYE STRAINING WITH CURIOSITY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0046.flac,HER FINGERS GRASPED THE HANDLE OF A DRAWER AND DREW IT FORTH IT WAS ENTIRELY EMPTY WITH LESS ALARM AND GREATER EAGERNESS SHE SEIZED A SECOND A THIRD A FOURTH EACH WAS EQUALLY EMPTY NOT ONE WAS LEFT UNSEARCHED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0047.flac,AND IN NOT ONE WAS ANYTHING FOUND WELL READ IN THE ART OF CONCEALING A TREASURE THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE LININGS TO THE DRAWERS DID NOT ESCAPE HER AND SHE FELT ROUND EACH WITH ANXIOUS ACUTENESS IN VAIN THE PLACE IN THE MIDDLE ALONE REMAINED NOW UNEXPLORED AND THOUGH SHE HAD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0048.flac,HER QUICK EYES DIRECTLY FELL ON A ROLL OF PAPER PUSHED BACK INTO THE FURTHER PART OF THE CAVITY APPARENTLY FOR CONCEALMENT AND HER FEELINGS AT THAT MOMENT WERE INDESCRIBABLE HER HEART FLUTTERED HER KNEES TREMBLED AND HER CHEEKS GREW PALE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0049.flac,SHE SEIZED WITH AN UNSTEADY HAND THE PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0050.flac,AND WHILE SHE ACKNOWLEDGED WITH AWFUL SENSATIONS THIS STRIKING EXEMPLIFICATION OF WHAT HENRY HAD FORETOLD RESOLVED INSTANTLY TO PERUSE EVERY LINE BEFORE SHE ATTEMPTED TO REST THE DIMNESS OF THE LIGHT HER CANDLE EMITTED MADE HER TURN TO IT WITH ALARM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0051.flac,A LAMP COULD NOT HAVE EXPIRED WITH MORE AWFUL EFFECT CATHERINE FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS MOTIONLESS WITH HORROR IT WAS DONE COMPLETELY NOT A REMNANT OF LIGHT IN THE WICK COULD GIVE HOPE TO THE REKINDLING BREATH DARKNESS IMPENETRABLE AND IMMOVABLE FILLED THE ROOM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0052.flac,A VIOLENT GUST OF WIND RISING WITH SUDDEN FURY ADDED FRESH HORROR TO THE MOMENT CATHERINE TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN THE PAUSE WHICH SUCCEEDED A SOUND LIKE RECEDING FOOTSTEPS AND THE CLOSING OF A DISTANT DOOR
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0053.flac,STRUCK ON HER AFFRIGHTED EAR HUMAN NATURE COULD SUPPORT NO MORE A COLD SWEAT STOOD ON HER FOREHEAD THE MANUSCRIPT FELL FROM HER HAND AND GROPING HER WAY TO THE BED SHE JUMPED HASTILY IN AND SOUGHT SOME SUSPENSION OF AGONY BY CREEPING FAR UNDERNEATH THE CLOTHES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0054.flac,TO CLOSE HER EYES IN SLEEP THAT NIGHT SHE FELT MUST BE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION WITH A CURIOSITY SO JUSTLY AWAKENED AND FEELINGS IN EVERY WAY SO AGITATED REPOSE MUST BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE THE STORM TOO ABROAD SO DREADFUL
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0055.flac,SHE HAD NOT BEEN USED TO FEEL ALARM FROM WIND BUT NOW EVERY BLAST SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH AWFUL INTELLIGENCE THE MANUSCRIPT SO WONDERFULLY FOUND SO WONDERFULLY ACCOMPLISHING THE MORNING'S PREDICTION HOW WAS IT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT COULD IT CONTAIN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0056.flac,BY WHAT MEANS COULD IT HAVE BEEN SO LONG CONCEALED AND HOW SINGULARLY STRANGE THAT IT SHOULD FALL TO HER LOT TO DISCOVER IT TILL SHE HAD MADE HERSELF MISTRESS OF ITS CONTENTS HOWEVER SHE COULD HAVE NEITHER REPOSE NOR COMFORT AND WITH THE SUN'S FIRST RAYS SHE WAS DETERMINED TO PERUSE IT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/218/89-218-0057.flac,AS IF BY THE ATTEMPT OF SOMEBODY TO ENTER HOLLOW MURMURS SEEMED TO CREEP ALONG THE GALLERY AND MORE THAN ONCE HER BLOOD WAS CHILLED BY THE SOUND OF DISTANT MOANS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0000.flac,INSTANTANEOUSLY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EXISTENCE RETURNED HER RECOLLECTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT AND SPRINGING FROM THE BED IN THE VERY MOMENT OF THE MAID'S GOING AWAY SHE EAGERLY COLLECTED EVERY SCATTERED SHEET WHICH HAD BURST FROM THE ROLL ON ITS FALLING TO THE GROUND AND FLEW BACK TO ENJOY THE LUXURY OF THEIR PERUSAL ON HER PILLOW
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0001.flac,SHE NOW PLAINLY SAW THAT SHE MUST NOT EXPECT A MANUSCRIPT OF EQUAL LENGTH WITH THE GENERALITY OF WHAT SHE HAD SHUDDERED OVER IN BOOKS FOR THE ROLL SEEMING TO CONSIST ENTIRELY OF SMALL DISJOINTED SHEETS WAS ALTOGETHER BUT OF TRIFLING SIZE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0002.flac,AND MUCH LESS THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE AT FIRST HER GREEDY EYE GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER A PAGE SHE STARTED AT ITS IMPORT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE OR DID NOT HER SENSES PLAY HER FALSE AN INVENTORY OF LINEN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0003.flac,IN COARSE AND MODERN CHARACTERS SEEMED ALL THAT WAS BEFORE HER IF THE EVIDENCE OF SIGHT MIGHT BE TRUSTED SHE HELD A WASHING BILL IN HER HAND SHE SEIZED ANOTHER SHEET AND SAW THE SAME ARTICLES WITH LITTLE VARIATION A THIRD A FOURTH AND A FIFTH PRESENTED NOTHING NEW
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0004.flac,SHIRTS STOCKINGS CRAVATS AND WAISTCOATS FACED HER IN EACH TWO OTHERS PENNED BY THE SAME HAND MARKED AN EXPENDITURE SCARCELY MORE INTERESTING IN LETTERS HAIR POWDER SHOE STRING AND BREECHES BALL AND THE LARGER SHEET
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0005.flac,TO SUPPOSE THAT A MANUSCRIPT OF MANY GENERATIONS BACK COULD HAVE REMAINED UNDISCOVERED IN A ROOM SUCH AS THAT SO MODERN SO HABITABLE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0006.flac,FOR HAD NOT THE CABINET APPEARED SO EXACTLY TO AGREE WITH HIS DESCRIPTION OF HER ADVENTURES SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FELT THE SMALLEST CURIOSITY ABOUT IT THIS WAS THE ONLY COMFORT THAT OCCURRED IMPATIENT TO GET RID OF THOSE HATEFUL EVIDENCES OF HER FOLLY THOSE DETESTABLE PAPERS THEN SCATTERED OVER THE BED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0007.flac,FOR SHE COULD NOW MANAGE THEM WITH PERFECT EASE IN THIS THERE WAS SURELY SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS AND SHE INDULGED IN THE FLATTERING SUGGESTION FOR HALF A MINUTE TILL THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DOOR'S HAVING BEEN AT FIRST UNLOCKED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0008.flac,AND YET UNEQUAL TO AN ABSOLUTE FALSEHOOD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0009.flac,BUT WE HAVE A CHARMING MORNING AFTER IT SHE ADDED DESIRING TO GET RID OF THE SUBJECT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0010.flac,AND HOW MIGHT YOU LEARN BY ACCIDENT OR ARGUMENT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0011.flac,AS A MEANS OF GETTING YOU OUT OF DOORS AND TEMPTING YOU TO MORE FREQUENT EXERCISE THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE TAKE AND THOUGH THE LOVE OF A HYACINTH MAY BE RATHER DOMESTIC WHO CAN TELL THE SENTIMENT ONCE RAISED BUT YOU MAY IN TIME COME TO LOVE A ROSE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0012.flac,BUT I DO NOT WANT ANY SUCH PURSUIT TO GET ME OUT OF DOORS THE PLEASURE OF WALKING AND BREATHING FRESH AIR IS ENOUGH FOR ME

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0014.flac,THE MERE HABIT OF LEARNING TO LOVE IS THE THING AND A TEACHABLENESS OF DISPOSITION IN A YOUNG LADY IS A GREAT BLESSING HAS MY SISTER A PLEASANT MODE OF INSTRUCTION CATHERINE WAS SAVED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF ATTEMPTING AN ANSWER BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE GENERAL
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0015.flac,WHOSE SMILING COMPLIMENTS ANNOUNCED A HAPPY STATE OF MIND BUT WHOSE GENTLE HINT OF SYMPATHETIC EARLY RISING DID NOT ADVANCE HER COMPOSURE THE ELEGANCE OF THE BREAKFAST SET FORCED ITSELF ON CATHERINE'S NOTICE WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE AND LUCIDLY IT HAD BEEN THE GENERAL'S CHOICE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0016.flac,HE WAS ENCHANTED BY HER APPROBATION OF HIS TASTE CONFESSED IT TO BE NEAT AND SIMPLE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO ENCOURAGE THE MANUFACTURE OF HIS COUNTRY AND FOR HIS PART TO HIS UNCRITICAL PALATE THE TEA WAS AS WELL FLAVOURED FROM THE CLAY OF STAFFORDSHIRE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0017.flac,HE TRUSTED HOWEVER THAT AN OPPORTUNITY MIGHT ERE LONG OCCUR OF SELECTING ONE THOUGH NOT FOR HIMSELF CATHERINE WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0018.flac,SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST HENRY LEFT THEM FOR WOODSTON WHERE BUSINESS REQUIRED AND WOULD KEEP HIM TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY ALL ATTENDED IN THE HALL TO SEE HIM MOUNT HIS HORSE AND IMMEDIATELY ON RE ENTERING THE BREAKFAST ROOM CATHERINE WALKED TO A WINDOW IN THE HOPE OF CATCHING ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF HIS FIGURE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0019.flac,OBSERVED THE GENERAL TO ELEANOR WOODSTON WILL MAKE BUT A SOMBRE APPEARANCE TODAY IS IT A PRETTY PLACE ASKED CATHERINE WHAT SAY YOU ELEANOR SPEAK YOUR OPINION FOR LADIES CAN BEST TELL THE TASTE OF LADIES IN REGARD TO PLACES AS WELL AS MEN

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0022.flac,DID HENRY'S INCOME DEPEND SOLELY ON THIS LIVING HE WOULD NOT BE ILL PROVIDED FOR PERHAPS IT MAY SEEM ODD THAT WITH ONLY TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN I SHOULD THINK ANY PROFESSION NECESSARY FOR HIM AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WE COULD ALL WISH HIM DISENGAGED FROM EVERY TIE OF BUSINESS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0023.flac,BUT THOUGH I MAY NOT EXACTLY MAKE CONVERTS OF YOU YOUNG LADIES I AM SURE YOUR FATHER MISS MORLAND WOULD AGREE WITH ME IN THINKING IT EXPEDIENT TO GIVE EVERY YOUNG MAN SOME EMPLOYMENT THE MONEY IS NOTHING IT IS NOT AN OBJECT BUT EMPLOYMENT IS THE THING
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0024.flac,HAS HIS PROFESSION THE IMPOSING EFFECT OF THIS LAST ARGUMENT WAS EQUAL TO HIS WISHES THE SILENCE OF THE LADY PROVED IT TO BE UNANSWERABLE SOMETHING HAD BEEN SAID THE EVENING BEFORE OF HER BEING SHOWN OVER THE HOUSE AND HE NOW OFFERED HIMSELF AS HER CONDUCTOR
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0025.flac,AND THOUGH CATHERINE HAD HOPED TO EXPLORE IT ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DAUGHTER IT WAS A PROPOSAL OF TOO MUCH HAPPINESS IN ITSELF UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE GLADLY ACCEPTED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0026.flac,AND HAD SEEN ONLY A FEW OF ITS ROOMS THE NETTING BOX JUST LEISURELY DRAWN FORTH WAS CLOSED WITH JOYFUL HASTE AND SHE WAS READY TO ATTEND HIM IN A MOMENT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0027.flac,THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING HER INTO THE SHRUBBERIES AND GARDEN SHE CURTSIED HER ACQUIESCENCE BUT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MORE AGREEABLE TO HER TO MAKE THOSE HER FIRST OBJECT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0028.flac,THE WEATHER WAS AT PRESENT FAVOURABLE AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE UNCERTAINTY WAS VERY GREAT OF ITS CONTINUING SO WHICH WOULD SHE PREFER HE WAS EQUALLY AT HER SERVICE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0029.flac,HE YIELDED IMPLICITLY AND WOULD FETCH HIS HAT AND ATTEND THEM IN A MOMENT HE LEFT THE ROOM AND CATHERINE WITH A DISAPPOINTED ANXIOUS FACE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HER UNWILLINGNESS THAT HE SHOULD BE TAKING THEM OUT OF DOORS AGAINST HIS OWN INCLINATION UNDER A MISTAKEN IDEA OF PLEASING HER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0030.flac,CATHERINE DID NOT EXACTLY KNOW HOW THIS WAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD WHY WAS MISS TILNEY EMBARRASSED COULD THERE BE ANY UNWILLINGNESS ON THE GENERAL'S SIDE TO SHOW HER OVER THE ABBEY THE PROPOSAL WAS HIS OWN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0031.flac,NEITHER HER FATHER NOR MISTER ALLEN DID SO IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY PROVOKING
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0032.flac,IF HENRY HAD BEEN WITH THEM INDEED BUT NOW SHE SHOULD NOT KNOW WHAT WAS PICTURESQUE WHEN SHE SAW IT SUCH WERE HER THOUGHTS BUT SHE KEPT THEM TO HERSELF AND PUT ON HER BONNET IN PATIENT DISCONTENT SHE WAS STRUCK HOWEVER BEYOND HER EXPECTATION BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE ABBEY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0033.flac,AS SHE SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE LAWN THE WHOLE BUILDING ENCLOSED A LARGE COURT AND TWO SIDES OF THE QUADRANGLE RICH IN GOTHIC ORNAMENTS STOOD FORWARD FOR ADMIRATION THE REMAINDER WAS SHUT OFF BY KNOLLS OF OLD TREES OR LUXURIANT PLANTATIONS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0034.flac,AND THE STEEP WOODY HILLS RISING BEHIND TO GIVE IT SHELTER WERE BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN THE LEAFLESS MONTH OF MARCH CATHERINE HAD SEEN NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH IT AND HER FEELINGS OF DELIGHT WERE SO STRONG THAT WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY BETTER AUTHORITY SHE BOLDLY BURST FORTH IN WONDER AND PRAISE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0035.flac,THE GENERAL LISTENED WITH ASSENTING GRATITUDE AND IT SEEMED AS IF HIS OWN ESTIMATION OF NORTHANGER HAD WAITED UNFIXED TILL THAT HOUR
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0036.flac,AND HE LED THE WAY TO IT ACROSS A SMALL PORTION OF THE PARK THE NUMBER OF ACRES CONTAINED IN THIS GARDEN WAS SUCH AS CATHERINE COULD NOT LISTEN TO WITHOUT DISMAY BEING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE EXTENT OF ALL MISTER ALLEN'S AS WELL AS HER FATHER'S INCLUDING CHURCH YARD AND ORCHARD

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0038.flac,AS HE SOON FORCED HER TO TELL HIM IN WORDS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY GARDENS AT ALL EQUAL TO THEM BEFORE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0039.flac,WITHOUT ANY AMBITION OF THAT SORT HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT HE DID BELIEVE THEM TO BE UNRIVALLED IN THE KINGDOM IF HE HAD A HOBBY HORSE IT WAS THAT HE LOVED A GARDEN THOUGH CARELESS ENOUGH IN MOST MATTERS OF EATING HE LOVED GOOD FRUIT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0040.flac,OR IF HE DID NOT HIS FRIENDS AND CHILDREN DID THERE WERE GREAT VEXATIONS HOWEVER ATTENDING SUCH A GARDEN AS HIS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0041.flac,WITH A TRIUMPHANT SMILE OF SELF SATISFACTION THE GENERAL WISHED HE COULD DO THE SAME
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0042.flac,BY ITS FALLING SHORT OF HIS PLAN HOW WERE MISTER ALLEN'S SUCCESSION HOUSES WORKED DESCRIBING THE NATURE OF HIS OWN AS THEY ENTERED THEM MISTER ALLEN HAD ONLY ONE SMALL HOT HOUSE WHICH MISSUS ALLEN HAD THE USE OF FOR HER PLANTS IN WINTER AND THERE WAS A FIRE IN IT NOW AND THEN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0043.flac,HE IS A HAPPY MAN SAID THE GENERAL WITH A LOOK OF VERY HAPPY CONTEMPT HAVING TAKEN HER INTO EVERY DIVISION AND LED HER UNDER EVERY WALL TILL SHE WAS HEARTILY WEARY OF SEEING AND WONDERING
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0044.flac,HE SUFFERED THE GIRLS AT LAST TO SEIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF AN OUTER DOOR AND THEN EXPRESSING HIS WISH TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SOME RECENT ALTERATIONS ABOUT THE TEA HOUSE PROPOSED IT AS NO UNPLEASANT EXTENSION OF THEIR WALK IF MISS MORLAND WERE NOT TIRED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0045.flac,BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING ELEANOR WHY DO YOU CHOOSE THAT COLD DAMP PATH TO IT MISS MORLAND WILL GET WET OUR BEST WAY IS ACROSS THE PARK
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0046.flac,SAID MISS TILNEY THAT I ALWAYS THINK IT THE BEST AND NEAREST WAY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0047.flac,IT WAS A NARROW WINDING PATH THROUGH A THICK GROVE OF OLD SCOTCH FIRS AND CATHERINE STRUCK BY ITS GLOOMY ASPECT AND EAGER TO ENTER IT COULD NOT EVEN BY THE GENERAL'S DISAPPROBATION BE KEPT FROM STEPPING FORWARD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0048.flac,HE PERCEIVED HER INCLINATION AND HAVING AGAIN URGED THE PLEA OF HEALTH IN VAIN WAS TOO POLITE TO MAKE FURTHER OPPOSITION HE EXCUSED HIMSELF HOWEVER FROM ATTENDING THEM THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE NOT TOO CHEERFUL FOR HIM AND HE WOULD MEET THEM BY ANOTHER COURSE HE TURNED AWAY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0049.flac,AND CATHERINE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND HOW MUCH HER SPIRITS WERE RELIEVED BY THE SEPARATION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0050.flac,OFFERED IT NO INJURY AND SHE BEGAN TO TALK WITH EASY GAIETY OF THE DELIGHTFUL MELANCHOLY WHICH SUCH A GROVE INSPIRED I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF THIS SPOT SAID HER COMPANION WITH A SIGH IT WAS MY MOTHER'S FAVOURITE WALK
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0051.flac,CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD MISSUS TILNEY MENTIONED IN THE FAMILY BEFORE AND THE INTEREST EXCITED BY THIS TENDER REMEMBRANCE SHOWED ITSELF DIRECTLY IN HER ALTERED COUNTENANCE AND IN THE ATTENTIVE PAUSE WITH WHICH SHE WAITED FOR SOMETHING MORE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0052.flac,ADDED ELEANOR THOUGH I NEVER LOVED IT THEN AS I HAVE LOVED IT SINCE AT THAT TIME INDEED I USED TO WONDER AT HER CHOICE BUT HER MEMORY ENDEARS IT NOW AND OUGHT IT NOT REFLECTED CATHERINE TO ENDEAR IT TO HER HUSBAND YET THE GENERAL WOULD NOT ENTER IT

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0056.flac,WAS SHE A VERY CHARMING WOMAN WAS SHE HANDSOME WAS THERE ANY PICTURE OF HER IN THE ABBEY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0057.flac,WAS IT FROM DEJECTION OF SPIRITS WERE QUESTIONS NOW EAGERLY POURED FORTH THE FIRST THREE RECEIVED A READY AFFIRMATIVE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0058.flac,HER PICTURE I SUPPOSE BLUSHING AT THE CONSUMMATE ART OF HER OWN QUESTION HANGS IN YOUR FATHER'S ROOM NO IT WAS INTENDED FOR THE DRAWING ROOM BUT MY FATHER WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE PAINTING AND FOR SOME TIME IT HAD NO PLACE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0059.flac,SOON AFTER HER DEATH I OBTAINED IT FOR MY OWN AND HUNG IT IN MY BED CHAMBER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0060.flac,IT IS VERY LIKE HERE WAS ANOTHER PROOF A PORTRAIT VERY LIKE OF A DEPARTED WIFE NOT VALUED BY THE HUSBAND HE MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFULLY CRUEL TO HER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0061.flac,IN SPITE OF ALL HIS ATTENTIONS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY EXCITED AND WHAT HAD BEEN TERROR AND DISLIKE BEFORE WAS NOW ABSOLUTE AVERSION YES AVERSION HIS CRUELTY TO SUCH A CHARMING WOMAN MADE HIM ODIOUS TO HER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0062.flac,SHE HAD OFTEN READ OF SUCH CHARACTERS CHARACTERS WHICH MISTER ALLEN HAD BEEN USED TO CALL UNNATURAL AND OVERDRAWN BUT HERE WAS PROOF POSITIVE OF THE CONTRARY SHE HAD JUST SETTLED THIS POINT WHEN THE END OF THE PATH BROUGHT THEM DIRECTLY UPON THE GENERAL
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0063.flac,AND IN SPITE OF ALL HER VIRTUOUS INDIGNATION SHE FOUND HERSELF AGAIN OBLIGED TO WALK WITH HIM LISTEN TO HIM AND EVEN TO SMILE WHEN HE SMILED BEING NO LONGER ABLE HOWEVER TO RECEIVE PLEASURE FROM THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS SHE SOON BEGAN TO WALK WITH LASSITUDE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/89/219/89-219-0064.flac,THE GENERAL PERCEIVED IT AND WITH A CONCERN FOR HER HEALTH WHICH SEEMED TO REPROACH HER FOR HER OPINION OF HIM WAS MOST URGENT FOR RETURNING WITH HIS DAUGHTER TO THE HOUSE HE WOULD FOLLOW THEM IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0000.flac,THIRTEENTH LECTURE THE DREAM ARCHAIC REMNANTS AND INFANTILISM IN THE DREAM LET US REVERT TO OUR CONCLUSION THAT THE DREAM WORK UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DREAM CENSORSHIP
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0001.flac,TRANSFORMS THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHTS INTO SOME OTHER FORM OF EXPRESSION THE LATENT THOUGHTS ARE NO OTHER THAN THE CONSCIOUS THOUGHTS KNOWN TO US IN OUR WAKING HOURS THE NEW MODE OF EXPRESSION IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO US BECAUSE OF ITS MANY SIDED FEATURES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0002.flac,SO WE CALLED THE MODE OF EXPRESSION OF THE DREAM WORK THE ARCHAIC OR REGRESSIVE YOU MAY CONCLUDE THAT AS A RESULT OF THE DEEPER STUDY OF THE DREAM WORK WE GAIN VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RATHER UNKNOWN BEGINNINGS OF OUR INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT I TRUST THIS WILL BE TRUE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0003.flac,BUT THIS WORK HAS NOT UP TO THE PRESENT TIME BEEN UNDERTAKEN THE ANTIQUITY INTO WHICH THE DREAM WORK CARRIES US BACK IS OF A DOUBLE ASPECT FIRSTLY THE INDIVIDUAL ANTIQUITY CHILDHOOD AND SECONDLY IN SO FAR AS EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN HIS CHILDHOOD
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0004.flac,THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE WHICH PART OF THE LATENT PSYCHIC PROCEEDING HAS ITS SOURCE IN THE INDIVIDUAL
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0005.flac,IN THIS CONNECTION IT APPEARS TO ME FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE SYMBOLIC RELATIONS WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL HAS NEVER LEARNED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0006.flac,HOWEVER THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ARCHAIC CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DREAM YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW FROM YOUR OWN EXPERIENCES THE PECULIAR AMNESIA THAT IS LOSS OF MEMORY CONCERNING CHILDHOOD I MEAN THE FACT THAT THE FIRST YEARS TO THE FIFTH
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0007.flac,THAT OF A GAP IN THE MEMORY IS FAR MORE FREQUENT I BELIEVE WE HAVE NOT LAID ENOUGH STRESS ON THIS FACT THE CHILD IS ABLE TO SPEAK WELL AT THE AGE OF TWO IT SOON SHOWS THAT IT CAN BECOME ADJUSTED TO THE MOST COMPLICATED PSYCHIC SITUATIONS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0008.flac,AND MAKES REMARKS WHICH YEARS LATER ARE RETOLD TO IT BUT WHICH IT HAS ITSELF ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN BESIDES THE MEMORY IN THE EARLY YEARS IS MORE FACILE BECAUSE IT IS LESS BURDENED THAN IN LATER YEARS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0009.flac,NOR IS THERE ANY REASON FOR CONSIDERING THE MEMORY FUNCTION AS A PARTICULARLY HIGH OR DIFFICULT PSYCHIC PERFORMANCE IN FACT THE CONTRARY IS TRUE AND YOU CAN FIND A GOOD MEMORY IN PERSONS WHO STAND VERY LOW INTELLECTUALLY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0010.flac,I MUST POINT OUT THAT CERTAIN WELL PRESERVED MEMORIES FOR THE MOST PART FORMATIVELY EXPERIENCED STAND FORTH IN THIS MEMORY VOID WHICH SURROUNDS THE FIRST YEARS OF CHILDHOOD AND DO NOT JUSTIFY THIS HYPOTHESIS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0011.flac,OUR MEMORY DEALS SELECTIVELY WITH ITS LATER MATERIALS WITH IMPRESSIONS WHICH COME TO US IN LATER LIFE IT RETAINS THE IMPORTANT AND DISCARDS THE UNIMPORTANT THIS IS NOT TRUE OF THE RETAINED CHILDHOOD MEMORIES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0012.flac,THEY DO NOT BESPEAK NECESSARILY IMPORTANT EXPERIENCES OF CHILDHOOD NOT EVEN SUCH AS FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE CHILD NEED APPEAR OF IMPORTANCE THEY ARE OFTEN SO BANAL AND INTRINSICALLY SO MEANINGLESS THAT WE ASK OURSELVES IN WONDER WHY JUST THESE DETAILS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0013.flac,HAVE ESCAPED BEING FORGOTTEN I ONCE ENDEAVORED TO APPROACH THE RIDDLE OF CHILDHOOD AMNESIA AND THE INTERRUPTED MEMORY REMNANTS WITH THE HELP OF ANALYSIS AND I ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT IN THE CASE OF THE CHILD TOO
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0014.flac,BY MEANS OF CAREFUL ANALYSIS ONE IS ABLE TO DEVELOP OUT OF THEM EVERYTHING THAT IS FORGOTTEN
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0015.flac,AND IN SO FAR AS THE CURE IS TO ANY DEGREE SUCCESSFUL WE ARE ABLE AGAIN TO BRING TO LIGHT THE CONTENT OF THE CHILDHOOD YEARS THUS CLOUDED IN FORGETFULNESS THESE IMPRESSIONS HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN FORGOTTEN THEY HAVE ONLY BEEN INACCESSIBLE LATENT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0016.flac,HAVE BELONGED TO THE UNCONSCIOUS BUT SOMETIMES THEY BOB UP OUT OF THE UNCONSCIOUS SPONTANEOUSLY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN DREAMS IT IS APPARENT THAT THE DREAM LIFE KNOWS HOW TO FIND THE ENTRANCE TO THESE LATENT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0017.flac,BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLES OF THIS OCCUR IN LITERATURE AND I MYSELF CAN PRESENT SUCH AN EXAMPLE I ONCE DREAMED IN A CERTAIN CONNECTION OF A PERSON WHO MUST HAVE PERFORMED SOME SERVICE FOR ME AND WHOM I CLEARLY SAW HE WAS A ONE EYED MAN SHORT IN STATURE STOUT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0018.flac,HIS HEAD DEEPLY SUNK INTO HIS NECK I CONCLUDED FROM THE CONTENT THAT HE WAS A PHYSICIAN LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO ASK MY MOTHER WHO WAS STILL LIVING HOW THE PHYSICIAN IN MY BIRTH PLACE WHICH I LEFT WHEN I WAS THREE YEARS OLD LOOKED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0019.flac,AND I LEARNED FROM HER THAT HE HAD ONE EYE WAS SHORT AND STOUT WITH HIS HEAD SUNK INTO HIS NECK AND ALSO LEARNED AT WHAT FORGOTTEN MISHAP HE HAD BEEN OF SERVICE TO ME THIS CONTROL OVER THE FORGOTTEN MATERIAL OF CHILDHOOD YEARS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0020.flac,IS THEN A FURTHER ARCHAIC TENDENCY OF THE DREAM THE SAME INFORMATION MAY BE MADE USE OF IN ANOTHER OF THE PUZZLES THAT HAVE PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO US YOU WILL RECALL HOW ASTONISHED PEOPLE WERE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0021.flac,WHEN WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE STIMULI WHICH GAVE RISE TO DREAMS WERE EXTREMELY BAD AND LICENTIOUS SEXUAL DESIRES WHICH HAVE MADE DREAM CENSORSHIP AND DREAM DISTORTION NECESSARY AFTER WE HAVE INTERPRETED SUCH A DREAM FOR THE DREAMER AND HE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0022.flac,IN THE MOST FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES DOES NOT ATTACK THE INTERPRETATION ITSELF HE ALMOST ALWAYS ASKS THE QUESTION WHENCE SUCH A WISH COMES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0023.flac,WE NEED NOT HESITATE TO POINT OUT THIS ORIGIN THESE EVIL WISH IMPULSES HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN THE PAST OFTEN IN A PAST WHICH IS NOT TOO FAR AWAY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0024.flac,THE WOMAN WHOSE DREAM IS INTERPRETED TO MEAN THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER DEAD DISCOVERS UNDER OUR GUIDANCE THAT SHE IN FACT AT ONE TIME ENTERTAINED THIS WISH
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0025.flac,WHICH EARLY ENDED IN A SEPARATION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0026.flac,SHE BEAT HER BODY WITH HER FISTS IN A FIT OF ANGER IN ORDER TO KILL THE CHILD HOW MANY MOTHERS WHO TO DAY LOVE THEIR CHILDREN TENDERLY PERHAPS TOO TENDERLY RECEIVED THEM UNWILLINGLY AND AT THE TIME WISHED THAT THE LIFE WITHIN THEM WOULD NOT DEVELOP FURTHER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0027.flac,INDEED TRANSLATED THIS WISH INTO VARIOUS ACTIONS HAPPILY HARMLESS THE LATER DEATH WISH AGAINST SOME LOVED ONE WHICH SEEMS SO STRANGE ALSO HAS ITS ORIGIN IN EARLY PHASES OF THE RELATIONSHIP TO THAT PERSON
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0028.flac,THIS WISH WAS NO STRANGER TO HIM WHILE THE CHILD WAS STILL A SUCKLING THIS MAN WHO WAS UNHAPPY IN HIS CHOICE OF A WIFE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT IF THE LITTLE BEING THAT MEANT NOTHING TO HIM WOULD DIE HE WOULD AGAIN BE FREE AND WOULD MAKE BETTER USE OF HIS FREEDOM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0029.flac,THAT SUCH WISHES AND SUCH DREAMS CANNOT OCCUR
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0030.flac,ONLY WISH TO WARN YOU THAT YOU ARE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION NOT THE EXACT TERMS OF THE DREAM BUT THE MEANING THEREOF ACCORDING TO ITS INTERPRETATION IT MAY HAPPEN THAT THE MANIFEST DREAM OF THE DEATH OF SOME LOVED PERSON HAS ONLY MADE USE OF SOME FRIGHTFUL MASK
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0031.flac,THAT IT REALLY MEANS SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT OR THAT THE LOVED PERSON SERVES AS A CONCEALING SUBSTITUTE FOR SOME OTHER BUT THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES WILL CALL FORTH ANOTHER MORE DIFFICULT QUESTION YOU SAY GRANTED THIS DEATH WISH WAS PRESENT AT SOME TIME OR OTHER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0032.flac,AND IS SUBSTANTIATED BY MEMORY YET THIS IS NO EXPLANATION IT IS LONG OUTLIVED TO DAY IT CAN BE PRESENT ONLY IN THE UNCONSCIOUS AND AS AN EMPTY EMOTIONLESS MEMORY BUT NOT AS A STRONG IMPULSE WHY SHOULD IT BE RECALLED BY THE DREAM AT ALL THIS QUESTION IS JUSTIFIED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0033.flac,IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS OF DREAM STUDY BUT I MUST REMAIN WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF OUR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE RESTRAINT PREPARE YOURSELVES FOR THE TEMPORARY ABSTENTION LET US BE SATISFIED WITH THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL PROOF
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0034.flac,THAT THIS OUTLIVED WISH CAN BE SHOWN TO ACT AS A DREAM STIMULATOR AND LET US CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT OTHER EVIL WISHES ADMIT OF THE SAME DERIVATION OUT OF THE PAST LET US CONTINUE WITH THE REMOVAL OR DEATH WISH
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0035.flac,WHICH MOST FREQUENTLY CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE UNBOUNDED EGOISM OF THE DREAMER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0036.flac,AS OFTEN AS SOMEONE HAS BEEN IN OUR WAY IN LIFE AND HOW OFTEN MUST THIS HAPPEN IN THE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS OF LIFE THE DREAM IS READY TO DO AWAY WITH HIM BE HE FATHER MOTHER BROTHER SISTER SPOUSE ET CETERA
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0037.flac,WE HAVE WONDERED SUFFICIENTLY OVER THIS EVIL TENDENCY OF HUMAN NATURE AND CERTAINLY WERE NOT PREDISPOSED TO ACCEPT THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS RESULT OF DREAM INTERPRETATION WITHOUT QUESTION AFTER IT HAS ONCE BEEN SUGGESTED TO US TO SEEK THE ORIGIN OF SUCH WISHES IN THE PAST
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/8975/270782/8975-270782-0038.flac,OR REAL REMNANTS THEREOF SHOW THEMSELVES FOR THE CHILD LOVES ITSELF FIRST AND LATER LEARNS TO LOVE OTHERS TO SACRIFICE SOMETHING OF ITS EGO FOR ANOTHER

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/909/131045/909-131045-0035.flac,THEY MAY OBVIATE THE FATAL INCONVENIENCES OF FLUCTUATING COUNCILS AND A VARIABLE POLICY THESE ARE SOME OF THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH WOULD FLOW FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF EXCLUSION THEY APPLY MOST FORCIBLY TO THE SCHEME OF A PERPETUAL EXCLUSION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/909/131045/909-131045-0036.flac,BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT EVEN A PARTIAL EXCLUSION WOULD ALWAYS RENDER THE READMISSION OF THE PERSON A REMOTE AND PRECARIOUS OBJECT THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE WILL APPLY NEARLY AS FULLY TO ONE CASE AS TO THE OTHER
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/909/131045/909-131045-0037.flac,WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES PROMISED TO COUNTERBALANCE THESE DISADVANTAGES THEY ARE REPRESENTED TO BE FIRST GREATER INDEPENDENCE IN THE MAGISTRATE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/909/131045/909-131045-0038.flac,UNLESS THE EXCLUSION BE PERPETUAL THERE WILL BE NO PRETENSE TO INFER THE FIRST ADVANTAGE BUT EVEN IN THAT CASE MAY HE HAVE NO OBJECT BEYOND HIS PRESENT STATION TO WHICH HE MAY SACRIFICE HIS INDEPENDENCE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/909/131045/909-131045-0039.flac,ON THE ARRIVAL OF WHICH HE NOT ONLY MAY BUT MUST BE EXPOSED TO THEIR RESENTMENTS UPON AN EQUAL PERHAPS UPON AN INFERIOR FOOTING IT IS NOT AN EASY POINT TO DETERMINE WHETHER HIS INDEPENDENCE WOULD BE MOST PROMOTED OR IMPAIRED BY SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/909/131045/909-131045-0040.flac,AS TO THE SECOND SUPPOSED ADVANTAGE THERE IS STILL GREATER REASON TO ENTERTAIN DOUBTS CONCERNING IT IF THE EXCLUSION WERE TO BE PERPETUAL A MAN OF IRREGULAR AMBITION OF WHOM ALONE THERE COULD BE REASON IN ANY CASE TO ENTERTAIN APPREHENSION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/909/131045/909-131045-0041.flac,WOULD WITH INFINITE RELUCTANCE YIELD TO THE NECESSITY OF TAKING HIS LEAVE FOREVER OF A POST IN WHICH HIS PASSION FOR POWER AND PRE EMINENCE HAD ACQUIRED THE FORCE OF HABIT AND IF HE HAD BEEN FORTUNATE OR ADROIT ENOUGH TO CONCILIATE THE GOOD WILL OF THE PEOPLE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/909/131045/909-131045-0042.flac,THERE MAY BE CONCEIVED CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THIS DISGUST OF THE PEOPLE SECONDING THE THWARTED AMBITION OF SUCH A FAVORITE MIGHT OCCASION GREATER DANGER TO LIBERTY THAN COULD EVER REASONABLY BE DREADED FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF A PERPETUATION IN OFFICE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/909/131045/909-131045-0043.flac,BY THE VOLUNTARY SUFFRAGES OF THE COMMUNITY EXERCISING A CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE THERE IS AN EXCESS OF REFINEMENT IN THE IDEA OF DISABLING THE PEOPLE TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE MEN WHO HAD ENTITLED THEMSELVES IN THEIR OPINION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0000.flac,ARE AS DUALISTIC AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE THOUGHTS WE ALL NATURALLY THINK ARE MADE OF ONE KIND OF SUBSTANCE AND THINGS OF ANOTHER CONSCIOUSNESS FLOWING INSIDE OF US IN THE FORMS OF CONCEPTION OR JUDGMENT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0001.flac,OR CONCENTRATING ITSELF IN THE SHAPE OF PASSION OR EMOTION CAN BE DIRECTLY FELT AS THE SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY WHICH IT IS AND KNOWN IN CONTRAST WITH THE SPACE FILLING OBJECTIVE CONTENT WHICH IT ENVELOPES AND ACCOMPANIES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0002.flac,IN OPPOSITION TO THIS DUALISTIC PHILOSOPHY I TRIED IN THE FIRST ESSAY TO SHOW THAT THOUGHTS AND THINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY HOMOGENEOUS AS TO THEIR MATERIAL AND THAT THEIR OPPOSITION IS ONLY ONE OF RELATION AND OF FUNCTION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0003.flac,THERE IS NO THOUGHT STUFF DIFFERENT FROM THING STUFF I SAID BUT THE SAME IDENTICAL PIECE OF PURE EXPERIENCE WHICH WAS THE NAME I GAVE TO THE MATERIA PRIMA OF EVERYTHING
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0004.flac,CAN STAND ALTERNATELY FOR A FACT OF CONSCIOUSNESS OR FOR A PHYSICAL REALITY ACCORDING AS IT IS TAKEN IN ONE CONTEXT OR IN ANOTHER FOR THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FOLLOWS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0005.flac,IN OUR PLEASURES AND PAINS OUR LOVES AND FEARS AND ANGERS IN THE BEAUTY COMICALITY IMPORTANCE OR PRECIOUSNESS OF CERTAIN OBJECTS AND SITUATIONS WE HAVE I AM TOLD BY MANY CRITICS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0006.flac,A GREAT REALM OF EXPERIENCE INTUITIVELY RECOGNIZED AS SPIRITUAL MADE AND FELT TO BE MADE OF CONSCIOUSNESS EXCLUSIVELY AND DIFFERENT IN NATURE FROM THE SPACE FILLING KIND OF BEING WHICH IS ENJOYED BY PHYSICAL OBJECTS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0007.flac,BECAUSE I HAD TO BE SO BRIEF I NOW RETURN TO THE SUBJECT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT SO FAR FROM INVALIDATING MY GENERAL THESIS THESE PHENOMENA WHEN PROPERLY ANALYZED AFFORD IT POWERFUL SUPPORT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0008.flac,THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE PURE EXPERIENCE THEORY IS THAT OUTER AND INNER ARE NAMES FOR TWO GROUPS INTO WHICH WE SORT EXPERIENCES ACCORDING TO THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ACT UPON THEIR NEIGHBORS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0009.flac,ANY ONE CONTENT SUCH AS HARD LET US SAY CAN BE ASSIGNED TO EITHER GROUP IN THE OUTER GROUP IT IS STRONG IT ACTS ENERGETICALLY AND AGGRESSIVELY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0010.flac,HERE WHATEVER IS HARD INTERFERES WITH THE SPACE ITS NEIGHBORS OCCUPY IT DENTS THEM IS IMPENETRABLE BY THEM AND WE CALL THE HARDNESS THEN A PHYSICAL HARDNESS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0011.flac,IN THE MIND ON THE CONTRARY THE HARD THING IS NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR IT DENTS NOTHING IT SUFFUSES THROUGH ITS MENTAL NEIGHBORS AS IT WERE AND INTERPENETRATES THEM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0012.flac,TAKEN IN THIS GROUP WE CALL BOTH IT AND THEM IDEAS OR SENSATIONS AND THE BASIS OF THE TWO GROUPS RESPECTIVELY IS THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF INTERRELATION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0013.flac,THE MUTUAL IMPENETRABILITY ON THE ONE HAND AND THE LACK OF PHYSICAL INTERFERENCE AND INTERACTION ON THE OTHER THAT WHAT IN ITSELF IS ONE AND THE SAME ENTITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO FUNCTION THUS DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0014.flac,IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXTREMELY COMPLEX RETICULATIONS IN WHICH OUR EXPERIENCES COME TO HER OFFSPRING A TIGRESS IS TENDER BUT CRUEL TO EVERY OTHER LIVING THING
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0015.flac,BOTH CRUEL AND TENDER THEREFORE AT ONCE A MASS IN MOVEMENT RESISTS EVERY FORCE THAT OPERATES CONTRARIWISE TO ITS OWN DIRECTION BUT TO FORCES THAT PURSUE THE SAME DIRECTION OR COME IN AT RIGHT ANGLES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0016.flac,IT IS ABSOLUTELY INERT IT IS THUS BOTH ENERGETIC AND INERT AND THE SAME IS TRUE IF YOU VARY THE ASSOCIATES PROPERLY OF EVERY OTHER PIECE OF EXPERIENCE
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0017.flac,IT IS ONLY TOWARDS CERTAIN SPECIFIC GROUPS OF ASSOCIATES THAT THE PHYSICAL ENERGIES AS WE CALL THEM OF A CONTENT ARE PUT FORTH IN ANOTHER GROUP IT MAY BE QUITE INERT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0018.flac,IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE A UNIVERSE OF EXPERIENCES IN WHICH THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN NEIGHBORS WOULD BE EITHER PHYSICAL INTERACTION OR COMPLETE INERTNESS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0019.flac,IN SUCH A WORLD THE MENTAL OR THE PHYSICAL STATUS OF ANY PIECE OF EXPERIENCE WOULD BE UNEQUIVOCAL WHEN ACTIVE IT WOULD FIGURE IN THE PHYSICAL AND WHEN INACTIVE IN THE MENTAL GROUP
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0020.flac,BUT THE UNIVERSE WE LIVE IN IS MORE CHAOTIC THAN THIS AND THERE IS ROOM IN IT FOR THE HYBRID OR AMBIGUOUS GROUP OF OUR AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES OF OUR EMOTIONS AND APPRECIATIVE PERCEPTIONS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0021.flac,IN THE PARAGRAPHS THAT FOLLOW I SHALL TRY TO SHOW ONE THAT THE POPULAR NOTION THAT THESE EXPERIENCES ARE INTUITIVELY GIVEN AS PURELY INNER FACTS IS HASTY AND ERRONEOUS AND TWO
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0022.flac,THAT THEIR AMBIGUITY ILLUSTRATES BEAUTIFULLY MY CENTRAL THESIS THAT SUBJECTIVITY AND OBJECTIVITY ARE AFFAIRS NOT OF WHAT AN EXPERIENCE IS ABORIGINALLY MADE OF BUT OF ITS CLASSIFICATION
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0023.flac,CLASSIFICATIONS DEPEND ON OUR TEMPORARY PURPOSES FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES IT IS CONVENIENT TO TAKE THINGS IN ONE SET OF RELATIONS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0024.flac,IN THE TWO CASES THEIR CONTEXTS ARE APT TO BE DIFFERENT IN THE CASE OF OUR AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES WE HAVE NO PERMANENT AND STEADFAST PURPOSE THAT OBLIGES US TO BE CONSISTENT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0025.flac,SO WE FIND IT EASY TO LET THEM FLOAT AMBIGUOUSLY SOMETIMES CLASSING THEM WITH OUR FEELINGS SOMETIMES WITH MORE PHYSICAL REALITIES ACCORDING TO CAPRICE OR TO THE CONVENIENCE OF THE MOMENT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0026.flac,THUS WOULD THESE EXPERIENCES SO FAR FROM BEING AN OBSTACLE TO THE PURE EXPERIENCE PHILOSOPHY SERVE AS AN EXCELLENT CORROBORATION OF ITS TRUTH FIRST OF ALL THEN IT IS A MISTAKE TO SAY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0027.flac,WITH THE OBJECTORS WHOM I BEGAN BY CITING THAT ANGER LOVE AND FEAR ARE AFFECTIONS PURELY OF THE MIND
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0028.flac,THEY ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY AFFECTIONS OF THE BODY
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0029.flac,AND WE ARE ALWAYS FREE TO SPEAK OF THEM IN OBJECTIVE AS WELL AS IN SUBJECTIVE TERMS WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE AWARE OF A PAINFUL PLACE FILLING A CERTAIN BIGNESS IN OUR ORGANISM
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0030.flac,OR WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE INWARDLY IN A STATE OF PAIN ALL OUR ADJECTIVES OF WORTH ARE SIMILARLY AMBIGUOUS
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0031.flac,OR IS IT A FEELING IN OUR MIND PRACTICALLY WE TREAT IT AS BOTH OR AS EITHER ACCORDING TO THE TEMPORARY DIRECTION OF OUR THOUGHT BEAUTY SAYS PROFESSOR SANTAYANA IS PLEASURE OBJECTIFIED
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0032.flac,AND IN SECTIONS TEN AND ELEVEN OF HIS WORK THE SENSE OF BEAUTY HE TREATS IN A MASTERLY WAY OF THIS EQUIVOCAL REALM THE VARIOUS PLEASURES WE RECEIVE FROM AN OBJECT
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0033.flac,MAY COUNT AS FEELINGS WHEN WE TAKE THEM SINGLY BUT WHEN THEY COMBINE IN A TOTAL RICHNESS WE CALL THE RESULT THE BEAUTY OF THE OBJECT AND TREAT IT AS AN OUTER ATTRIBUTE WHICH OUR MIND PERCEIVES
../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0034.flac,WE DISCOVER BEAUTY JUST AS WE DISCOVER THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THINGS TRAINING IS NEEDED TO MAKE US EXPERT IN EITHER LINE SINGLE SENSATIONS ALSO MAY BE AMBIGUOUS SHALL WE SAY

../LibriSpeech/train-clean-100/911/128684/911-128684-0070.flac,THAT PRIMARILY APPEAL TO OUR ATTENTION IN OUR COMMERCE WITH NATURE THESE ATTRIBUTES ARE WHAT GIVE EMPHASIS TO OBJECTS AND FOR AN OBJECT TO BE EMPHATIC WHATEVER SPIRITUAL FACT IT MAY MEAN
